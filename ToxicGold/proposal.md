**Propored Title:** Toxic Gold: The Hidden Cost of Nigeria’s Mining Boom.

**Working Title:** *Toxic Gold: How Global Prices Are Contaminating Nigeria’s Crops*

**Summary:**
As gold prices rise globally, small-scale miners across Nigeria increasingly rely on mercury to extract the metal. New scientific evidence reveals that mercury released into the air during this process is settling onto nearby farmland, contaminating staple crops. The story exposes the invisible link between the world’s appetite for gold and the quiet poisoning of rural communities.

**Angle:**

* Science: Airborne mercury uptake through leaves, not soil.
* Economy: How gold demand drives mercury imports and informal trade.
* Policy: Weak enforcement of the Minamata Convention in Nigeria.
* Human: The health toll on miners, farmers, and families downwind.

**Reporting Plan:**

* Interviews: Environmental scientists, local farmers, public-health officials, and artisanal miners.
* Data: C&EN/ACS findings, Nigeria’s mining ministry reports, and WHO mercury guidelines.
* Visuals: Field photos, supply-chain map, and contamination chart.

**Estimated Length:** 1,200–1,500 words
**Format:** Feature / multimedia story
**Potential Outlets:** *Mongabay, The Conversation Africa, The Guardian Environment, Al Jazeera Features, Thomson Reuters Foundation.*

**Subject:** Pitch: How Rising Gold Prices Are Poisoning Nigeria’s Food Crops

**Body:**

Dear [Editor’s Name],

I’d like to pitch an investigative feature revealing how global gold prices are quietly fuelling mercury contamination in Nigeria’s farmlands and food supply.

New research published by the American Chemical Society shows that crops near artisanal gold-mining zones in Nigeria are absorbing mercury directly from the air rather than from soil or water — a discovery that reframes our understanding of toxic exposure in mining regions.

This piece will follow the chain from global gold markets to informal mercury imports, on-site mining practices, and finally, to food on the table in rural Nigerian homes. It will weave together science, policy, and lived experience to show how the pursuit of gold has turned into a hidden public-health crisis.

I can deliver a 1,400-word feature enriched with original interviews, data visualisations, and environmental policy context. The story is timely, global in relevance, and deeply human at its core.

Kind regards,

**Subject:** Pitch: The Toxic Trade Behind Nigeria’s Artisanal Gold Rush

**Body:**

Dear [Editor’s Name],

I am proposing a feature that exposes a growing but overlooked environmental and public-health risk in Nigeria — mercury contamination from artisanal gold mining.

Recent scientific findings show that crops such as cassava and maize grown around mining communities are absorbing mercury directly from the air. The rise in global gold prices has pushed more small-scale miners to use mercury, often bought through informal trade networks, with devastating effects on local food and health.

The story will follow the full chain — from the gold fields of Zamfara and Niger States, to the markets selling mercury illegally, to the farmers and families living with the unseen consequences. It will also explore what Nigeria’s commitment to the Minamata Convention means in practice, and what local solutions are emerging.

I can deliver a 1,000- to 1,200-word feature with interviews, local data, and strong human voices.

Warm regards,

Would you like me to now help you refine **the narrative hook or opening paragraph** (the “lede”) for whichever version you plan to pitch first? It would give your email an even stronger edge when editors scan for standout submissions.
