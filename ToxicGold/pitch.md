**Subject:** Story Pitch — How Rising Gold Prices Are Poisoning Nigerian Food Crops

**Body:**

Dear [Editor’s Name],

I’m writing to pitch an investigative and human-centred story on how surging global gold prices are fuelling mercury contamination in Nigeria’s crops — with far-reaching health and environmental consequences.

Recent research published by the American Chemical Society reveals that crops grown near artisanal gold-mining areas in Nigeria are absorbing mercury directly from the air, not the soil — a shift that challenges long-held assumptions about how pollutants enter the food chain.

My piece will trace how mercury enters Nigeria through poorly regulated trade routes, is sold to small-scale miners, and ends up in everyday foods like cassava and maize. It will combine ground-level voices (farmers, traders, miners), policy analysis (Nigeria’s obligations under the Minamata Convention), and data visualisation of contamination hotspots.

This story connects economics, environment, and public health — showing how global gold demand translates into invisible toxic exposure for rural Nigerians. I can deliver a 1,200–1,500-word feature with photos, infographics, and verified scientific references.

Please let me know if you’d like an outline or sample draft.

Kind regards,
