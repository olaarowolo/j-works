Adebiyia,b,⁎aDangote Oil Refinery Co Ltd., Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, NigeriabDepartment of Chemistry, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, NigeriaABSTRACTARTICLE  INFOAmong the fossil fuels, petroleum is more valuable to several businesses due to the production of extensive assortmentsoffinished products, making it a pivot natural resource in the development of the world's economic system via energyusage which are 32% for Europe and Asia, Middle East (53%), South and Central America (44%), Africa (41%), andNorth America (40%). The most apparent air pollution impediments of the petroleum industry are concentrated inits refining segment. Various pollutants are discharged from different phases of the petroleum refining process. Thisarticle intends at publicising dispersed information and also close the knowledge gap in the area. It offers an updateon processes involved in petroleum refining, air pollution sources, impacts, reviews onfindings, and highlights fromdifferent scientific reports on air quality and management. It is paramount that establishing as well as imposing envi-ronmental protocols in the petroleum refining industry are crucial for controlling air pollution to protectflora andfauna including human beings. Moreso, the ambient air quality should be managed methodically in developing coun-tries where increased energy demands, industrialization, and overpopulation is leading to increased emissions andreduced air value.Keywords:Air qualityAtmosphereManagement practicesPetroleumPollutionRefineryContents1.

IntroductionEnvironment is referred to as an aggregate of both the non-living andliving things as well as their impacts on the living existence of human be-ings. It is ascribed to be the entirety of both the physical and biotic sur-roundings in which human life and toils are carried out or a place ofabode for plants and animals. It is the surroundings in which human beings,fauna, andflora survive or function. It is generally observed that in recentcenturies, anthropogenic influences have distorted the harmony of the eco-systems (air, soil, and water), changed the surface of the earth's crust, andredesigned the standard of living [1]. Anthropogenic activities, most espe-cially the industrial revolutions are altering the ecosystems to some extentat an astronomical measure in this modern era. For instance, industrial pol-lutions from petroleum refining processes have shattered many wildlife andnaturally occurring habitats [2–4].While industrialization is very crucial in the economic advance of anycountry, industries have been observed to be the principal donors of ecosys-tem pollution challenges globally. Contrary to the ideologies of sustainablegrowth, unrestrained industrial processes in some countries have resultedin elevated quantities of dangerous and noxious messes in the ecosystems.Pollution is the introduction of contaminants or pollutants into the naturalenvironment that results in undesirable modification making an ecosystemunwholesome and intolerable to humans and biomes [5–7].Petroleum coupled with its refined products performs immense and cru-cial parts in the global setting. Apart from being a central energy source, re-fined petroleum products offer feedstock to other numerous industries.Hence, performing a mounting and pertinent part in the life of human be-ings by generating numerous jobs and a noteworthy size of tax revenuesand royalties for the local, state, and national governments including for-eign earnings. According to Monteiro [7], the petroleum industry footingsa chief latent of threats for the environment, and influences ecosystemsand subsequently all living organisms including human beings. Based onthe aforementioned issue, the principal prevalent and perilous concern ofpetroleum industry undertakings is environmental devastation. In the pe-troleum industry, pollution is practically similar to all processes of oil andgas production, from petroleum exploration to refining, transportation,and marketing. Series of wastes including aerosols, gas emissions, wastewa-ters, and solid waste is produced during processes of the development of pe-troleum with accompanied by more than 800 various toxic chemicalsubstances. The environmental effects of this pollution are increasinggreenhouse effect; acid rain; biodiversity harm; air, soil, and water-deprived quality [8,9].According to Sojinu and Ejeromedoghene [10], after mining and trans-portation of crude oil to the refinery, it will then pass-through refining pro-cesses so as to transform it into refined products of high commercial worth.The petroleum refinery is an industrial set up-plant where crude oil istreated and refined into various products (e.g., kerosene, diesel fuel, gaso-line, asphalt base, liquefied petroleum gas, and heating oil) of high eco-nomic values. Petroleum refining is one of the principal industriesglobally and a crucial segment of the global economy. Conversely, prospec-tive environmental threats connected to refineries have resulted in greatconcern for people dwelling in communities nearby [6,11,12].Damian [13] reported that the petroleum refining industry contributessubstantially to the entire aerial system pollution by industrial emissionsand impaired atmosphere with hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide, hydrogensulphide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matters, andother poisonous materials, while the principal pollutants are hydrocarbonsand sulphur dioxide.This review article is restricted to air pollution in petroleum reefing be-cause petroleum refineries are known to be the foremost aerial polluter.Most potential air pollution impacts related to petroleum refining industryactivities are already well documented but dispersed in papers or exist inthe crania of experts corresponding to undeclared knowledge. It is thus cru-cial to publicize the information and also close the knowledge gaps in thedocumented reports. Thus, this article basically gives updates on petroleumcomposition, operations involved in petroleum refining, air pollutionsources, impacts, prevention, and mitigation schemes. This article also of-fers a review offindings and highlights from different scientific reports onair quality and management in the petroleum refining industry. Further-more, it sums up a conclusion and submits valued future directions in thesubjectfield.2. Literature review2.1. Petroleum and its compositionOllivier and Magot [14] reported that the term petroleum is a two com-pound Latin word viz., petra and oleum meaningrockandoilrespectively.Petroleum is a general term that classifies collectively as a group of organicliquids, gases, and or asphaltic solids that was produced after kerogen washeated and compacted through high pressure over lengthy periods of time.Petroleum is naturally occurring and originates in geological formations be-neath the Earth's surface. It can be refined into fractions such as kerosene,natural gas, gasoline, naphtha, paraffin wax, lubricating oils, and asphaltof higher economic values [14]. It is also employed as a source of raw ma-terial for the broad diversity of derived products. It is a fossil fuel, indicatingthat it was produced via the microbial degradation of organic material prin-cipally zooplankton and algae below the sedimentary rock that have beenexposed to high levels of heat and pressure for millions of years. Petroleumis fairly multifaceted; the principal constituent gas of petroleum is naturalgas, which is mainly methane (CH4), while the key liquid constituent iscrude oil. Refined petroleum products such as diesel, kerosene, gasoline,and heating oil also partake in the designation ofpetroleum. The petroleumsector categorizes crude based on the place of its source and relative densityor viscosity i.e. heavy, intermediate, or light. The comparative level of sul-phur, which is in form of elemental sulphur or in compounds such as hydro-gen sulphide (H2S) in the crude, makes it to be referred to as eithersweetorsour, i.e. crude of low and high sulphur contents respectively [15,16].Speight [16]reportedthatthecompositionofpetroleumvariesbroadlysubject to where and how it was formed. This variation in petroleum com-position accounts for the differences in colour and viscosity between crudeoil wells and geographical zones. Actually, chemical investigation is usuallyemployed tofingerprint the origin of petroleum because crudes of differentorigins possess divergent compositions and properties. Crude oil consists ofnumerous chemical compounds and the utmost productive among them arethe hydrocarbons which offer thecrude oil compositionits explosive na-ture. According to Baker [17], crude oil comprises of four hydrocarbongroups, which include alkanes(paraffin, 15–60%),cycloalkanes(naph-thenes, 30–60%),aromatics(3–30%),and asphalts (resins and asphaltenes,NSOs heteroatomic compounds which also hold trace quantities of metalssuch as vanadium, nickel, iron, and copper).Nonetheless, the hydrocarbons primarily are alkanes, cycloalkanes, andaromatics. Paraffins are the primary hydrocarbons in petroleum; gasoline(petrol) constitutes mostly definite liquid paraffins making them of higheconomic value. Naphthenes are a significant fragment of the liquid refin-ery products, nevertheless, they are also constituted by various heavyasphalt-like residues of refinery practices. Largely, aromatics form a lowpercentage of many crudes [16]. Resins and asphaltenes constitute thedark coloured constituent of petroleum and they are comparatively polar,high-molecular-weight, aromatic, polycyclic ring compound componentsF.M.
