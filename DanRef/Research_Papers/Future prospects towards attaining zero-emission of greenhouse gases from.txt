The end results of this has been linked to global warming causing adverse effects on public health and making the environment unsafe for living. This review article examines the challenges and effects emanating from the release of greenhouse gases from crude oil refining operations. In-depth discussions and salient points, shedding light for prospective researchers on the critical areas that should be investigated and improved on to attain net-zero emissions in refinery, were presented. The effects of the increase in the global number of re-fineries on GHG emissions trend in top countries are discussed. Top 10 countries and refinery industries with the highest GHG emissions were referenced as case studies. Between 2000 and 2021, the cumulative GHG emissions from  refineries attained 34.1 Gt  due to increase in  the number of refineries while the top 10  enterprises accounted for approximately 33.8–38.1 %. Accumulative reduction of 532 Mt and 928 Mt of CO2 emissions are expected between 2020 and 2030 if the efficiencies of refineries in the top 10 countries and global refineries are respectively improved. Technologies such  as  hydrogen-based refining and  carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); integration of circular economy principles; green financing and government-backed incentives; and government-based policies are some of the steps that can be taken to make reduction of GHG emissions from refineries a reality. In conclusion, the stated vital points regarding future prospects towards attaining net-zero emissions from crude oil refinery plants will be beneficial for prospective researchers and the entire globe.1. IntroductionCrude oil refineries are vital sectors of the global energy industry which convert crude oil into valuable products such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and petrochemicals. However, the processes required in their production significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, posing substantial risks to the environment and human health (Wei et al., 2016). Refineries account for sulfur oxides (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions which are linked to global warming, smog formation, acid rain and serious respiratory diseases (Popoola et al., 2013a). Owning by the rising global climate crisis, there is a growing urgency for the oil and gas industry, particularly refineries, to lower their carbon footprint. The shift toward net-zero emissions target is becoming a central pillar of environmental policy and corporate sus-tainability (Zhao et al., 2019). In the context of refineries, net-zero emissions means drastically reducing emissions from both refining op-erations and the energy required to power those operations, with any remaining emissions being either captured or offset through various methods. In this regard, it is essential for refineries to adopt strategies to alleviate their contribution to global warming while ensuring energy security and economic viability (Baltrenas et al., 2011).The various sources of GHG in crude oil refineries are those origi-nating majorly from (1) fossil fuels combustion purposely for power generation, heating and refining processes; (2) reforming and catalytic cracking processes which are  employed in  converting heavy *Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: popoolalekantaofeek@yahoo.com, ltpopoola@abuad.edu.ng(L.T.

hydrocarbons into  more  valuable lighter fractions releasing volatile organic compounds like benzene, toluene and xylene into the atmo-sphere; (3) unintentional leaks of gases coming from equipment such as valves, tanks, pipes and compressors; and (4) flaring which involves the burning of excess gases (Adebiyi et al., 2015). Though flaring lowers immediate safety risks, significant CO₂ and other pollutants particulate matter, CO and hydrocarbons are often generated. Fig. 1shows the global CO2 emissions from some countries around the world between 2000 and 2020.The achievement of net-zero emissions is a vital objective in tackling climate change, and this objective extends to industries such as re-fineries, which are among the highest donors to global CO₂ emissions (Popoola and  Yusuff, 2021a).  The  challenge of  achieving net-zero emissions for  refineries is  particularly complex as  a  result of  their huge dependence on fossil fuels. Crude oil is the primary raw material for refining, and refineries also depend on fossil fuels like natural gas and fuel oil, to power energy-intensive processes like distillation and cracking. These high-temperature processes are essential for separating and converting crude oil into usable products but also generate signifi-cant  CO₂ emissions through fossil  fuels  combustion (Laturkar and Laturkar, 2023a). Based on this, achieving net-zero emissions for re-fineries necessitates a transformation in both the way refineries operate and the energy sources they rely upon.To reach net-zero emissions, refineries must focus on two key stra-tegies: emission reduction and carbon offsetting. Emission reduction effort is targeted at cutting down the direct emissions produced during refinery operations (Saleh and Hassan, 2024). This can be attained via improving energy efficiency, shifting to renewable energy sources, and adopting new  technologies that  minimize carbon emissions. For example, refineries could integrate sources of renewable energy such as solar, wind, or biomass into their operations to replace carbon-intensive fossil fuels. In addition, energy-efficient technologies and process opti-mization can assist in minimizing the total energy required to carry out refining operations, thus lowering emissions (Popoola et al., 2018).On  the  other  hand, carbon offsetting involves compensating for remaining emissions through activities that reduce or capture carbon elsewhere. One of the most promising technologies for carbon offsetting in refineries is carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Onakpohor et al., 2024). Though CCS is still at the initial stage of implementation and development, it  offers significant potential for  reducing the  carbon footprint of industries like refining. Additionally, refineries could invest in  projects that  contribute to  carbon sequestration, such  as  forest restoration or renewable energy initiatives; to offset their remaining emissions (Michael and Joepen, 2021). This review critically explores the available technologies to achieve net-zero emissions in refineries. It provides information on the cumulative GHG emissions generated from top 10 refineries and countries of location. Information on the potential techniques that could be adopted and the expected volume of GHG emissions that could be reduced is presented. This paper bridges the gap between the industry and prospective researchers on how zero-emission of greenhouse gases from crude oil refinery plants could be attained via comprehensive explanations of future prospects in this regard.2. Techniques for attaining net-zero emissions in refineriesAs  previously mentioned, the  two  strategies via  which net-zero emissions can be attained in refineries are emission reduction and car-bon  offsetting. These strategies are  often  interconnected and  may necessitate significant initial investments, but  they  offer  substantial long-term environmental and  economic benefits. This  is  a  complex mission that requires the adoption of technologies aimed at reducing emissions throughout both production and energy generation processes. •Emission Reduction The effective technologies which may be applicable in achieving emission reduction include (1) improvements of energy efficiency, (2) integration of renewable energy and (3) hydrogen utilization in crude oil refinery plants. The improvement of energy efficiency is one of the greatest effective and immediate strategies for reducing emissions in refineries. By optimizing refinery processes, upgrading equipment, and implementing advanced energy management sys-tems (EMS), refineries can considerably minimize energy consump-tion.  For  example, systems of  heat  recovery allow refineries to capture and reuse waste heat, minimizing the need for additional energy inputs (Kang et al., 2020). By implementing EMS, refineries can monitor and control energy usage, ensuring that energy is used efficiently across operations. These improvements can  lead  to reduced operating costs and a substantial decline in carbon emis-sions, contributing to  both  economic savings and  environmental goals. Another essential strategy for attaining net-zero emissions in re-fineries is the integration of renewable energy sources. Refineries traditionally rely on fossil fuels like fuel oil and natural gas for energy-intensive processes. By  shifting to  different sources of Fig. 1.Global CO2 emissions from some countries around the world.L.T. Popoola et al.

renewable energy such as wind, solar or biomass, refineries can significantly minimize their  carbon footprint. These renewable sources can power operations such as distillation, cracking, and other high-temperature processes, which are typically fossil fuel-dependent. This does not only help in reducing CO₂ emissions but also contributes to the broader decarbonization efforts in the energy sector (Al-Rubaye et al., 2023). Hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen manufactured via renew-able electricity, is emerging as a promising clean energy source for the  refining industry. Hydrogen can  replace natural gas  in energy-intensive refining processes such as hydrocracking and hy-drogenation. These processes are  essential for  producing refined products, but they are typically carbon-intensive when powered by fossil fuels. Green hydrogen offers a cleaner alternative, enabling refineries to reduce their carbon emissions while maintaining pro-duction efficiency. Additionally, hydrogen can be used to produce hydrogenated products, such as clean fuels, further supporting the refinery’s decarbonization goals. As hydrogen production technol-ogy continues to advance, its integration into the refining sector could be helpful in minimizing emissions (Zhao et al., 2021a).•Carbon offsettingCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is a vital technique of carbon offsetting from the atmosphere to attain net-zero emissions in refineries. This  technology involves capturing CO₂ directly from  the  point  of emission, such as from a refinery’s smokestack, and transporting it to be deposited in  underground geological formations (Ragothaman and Anderson, 2017). CCS has the ability to capture a significant portion of a refinery’s CO₂ emissions, offering a feasible solution for industries that continue to produce high levels of carbon emissions. Although CCS technology is still in development and faces challenges in terms of scalability and cost, it is widely recognized as a key component of a broader strategy for reducing industrial emissions. By implementing CCS, refineries can effectively mitigate a large portion of their emissions, helping to meet net-zero targets.2.1.Influence of increase in crude oil refinery numbers on GHG emissions trend in some countries around the globeBetween 2010  and  2018, approximately 24 %  increase in  GHG emissions was linked to the crude oil refining sector while a reduction by 9 % was noticed after these years due to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic (Lei  et  al.,  2021).  Crude oil  refineries number increased from 739 to 839 between 2000 and 2021 from which the United States, China, United Kingdom and Europe took approximately 53 % of the global number making them to  be among the regions with highest number of refineries. Though a decline in the number of refineries from 155 to 123 was recorded in the United States, the volume of crude oil being refined steadily and  approximately remained constant at  17 million barrels per day (Mbd). In contrary, decrease in the crude oil volume refined (due to reduction in the average capacity of refinery) by 84.2 % and 39.1 % was recorded for the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa respectively. In  China, the  increase in  the  refineries number from 127 to 179 before 2007 greatly influenced the level of crude oil demand resulting in average refinery capacity increase after 2007 (Dietz et al., 2021).Consequently, the number of refineries greatly increased around the world causing the total GHG emissions from refineries globally to attain 34.1 Gt between 2000 and 2021. This record was based on an annual average increase at the rate of 0.7 % with the United States, China and EU27&UK contributing 24.1 %, 12.6 % and 15.6 % respectively of the total  GHG  emissions. Refineries located in  China recorded approxi-mately times three of the GHG emissions between 2000 and 2021 from 102.2 to 313.3 Mt. A similar case was reported in refineries located in India with rapid GHG emissions. However, a decline in the GHG emis-sions in refineries located in the Unites States from 25.9 % to 22.5 % between 2000 and 2021 did not deny them being ranked first around the globe. The order of GHG emissions from crude oil refining operations with reference to top ten countries around the world as at 2021 is United States >China >Russia >India >Japan >South Korea >Iran >Saudi Arabia >Italy >Brazil recording approximately 8.94>4.83>2.22>2.03>1.81>1.52>1.18>1.06>0.88>-0.71 (CO2 equivalent Gt) (Ma et al., 2023) as shown in Fig. 2.Global records have  revealed the  existence of  498  enterprises comprising 1095 refineries under their control. Out of these, only 4 % of the total enterprise (approximately 20 enterprises) dominated both the global GHG emissions and oil refining production between 2000 and 2021 (Zaman and Moemen, 2017). The United States, Russia, China and India took five, three, two and two respectively out of the top 20 en-terprises while the United Kingdom, Brazil, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, France, the Netherlands, Japan and Iran took one each (Zaman and Moemen, 2017). Between 2000 and 2021, the top 10 out of the 20 en-terprises accounted for  33.8–38.1 %  of  the  GHG  emissions while 17.7–20.5 %  was  recorded for  the  remaining 10  enterprises. The respective average carbon emission intensity for the two groups were ranging 61.4–62.4 and 56.3–59.1 kgCO2eq/bbl. The order of cumulative GHG  emissions from  the  top  ten  enterprises engaging in  crude oil refining is China Petrochemical Corp (China) >China National Petro-leum Corp (China) >Exxon Mobil Corp (United States) >Valero Energy Corp (United States) >Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Arabia) >Royal Dutch Shell  Plc  (Netherlands) >Marathon Petroleum Corp  (United States) >Rosneft Oil Co (Russia) >ENEOS Corp (Japan) >Chevron Corp (United States) emitting 1553.528>1445.516>1428.638 >1418.899>1270.252>1164.017>1120.754>1051.236>924. 141>869.692 Mt respectively as at 2021 (Ma et al., 2023). This in-formation is presented in Fig. 3.2.2.State-of-the-art on achieving net-zero emissions from crude oil refinery plantsTable 1presents previous studies conducted and the state-of-the-art regarding how net-zero emissions could be attained from crude oil re-finery plants. This comprises the title of the article consulted; scope of study and methodology; limitations; Observations and results obtained; strategies or technologies adopted for GHG emissions reduction; and conclusions. The table summarizes the role of refineries on the global economy and the adverse effects of GHG emissions during operations on the environment and human health. From the consulted literatures, it was made known that larger reduction of emissions could be attained while still aspiring betterment towards absolute transitioning to net-zero emissions. In summary, with reference to the articles consulted, studies have shown that appreciable cost will be needed by refinery in tackling GHG emissions and there is need to adopt cleaner technologies. The benefits of renewable energy incorporation into refinery operations; strengthening and  enforcing of  regulations for  sustainable environ-mental safety; feasible outcome of positive and favorable policies from the government; the necessity for international collaborations among countries to tackle global warming; the need to fund research studies in the area of GHG emissions; the importance and significance of public and community awareness on global warming effects; and how the recommended strategies of GHG emissions reduction can be sustainable for  future reference are  the  major suggestions, observations and conclusions.2.3.Analysis of the potential outcomes of global GHG emissions reduction in crude oil refineries using technological approachesSuggestions are made and some proactive steps have been taken by refineries around the globe to reduce GHG emissions. It has been pro-jected that CO2 emissions (which form part of GHG) could be reduced by 3–6 % between 2020 and 2030 if refineries’ efficiencies are improved globally without the  addition of  new  refineries (Marschinski et  al., L.T. Popoola et al.
