with 3–5 years and less than 3 years make up 14.67 % and 8 %, respectively. This suggests that more experienced investors, who are likely to have encountered flood-related challenges, dominate the market. Their investment choices may be influenced by their prior exposure to flood risks, adaptive strategies, and perceptions of long-term property sustainability.4.2. Ethical considerationsThe ethical considerations in this study were key in developing the research and ensuring that the data are used as stated in the questionnaire. The data used for the study were collected between February and May 2022. The data was obtained from respondents who were all informed about the purpose of the study. The respondents gave their consent to use the data for the research and they shared their responses willingly. The research questionnaire was also used to inform the respondent about the research and the re-sponsibility of the researchers in the investigation. The data collection in this study protects the respondents’ data and ensures that the interests of the respondents are safeguarded. There was no coercion exerted on the people who participated in the survey to induce them to respond. The research participants were all given a rundown of the objectives of the study as well as the rationale behind their selection. Due to their participation in this study, they were in no way misled or subjected to any kind of stress that may affect the information provided. The respondents were also assured that they would remain anonymous during the process.4.3. Method of data analysisTo easily understand, ensure consistency and reliability and unify the responses, the study employed the Likert scale as a tool. The Likert scale is a well-established psychometric tool that facilitates the measurement of attitudes, perceptions, and opinions across various contexts. Its structured format allows respondents to express varying degrees of agreement or disagreement regarding specific statements, which provides nuanced insights into their perceptions of each factor. This study had to adopt the tool following its adoption and vast use in various studies as a significant tool in evaluating the perception of stakeholders on studies [59,60] in the built environment. The tool used in this study possess the ability to capture the complexity of participants’ attitudes toward multiple factors influencing investment decisions in flood-prone areas. This enables respondents to convey the intensity of their feelings, which is crucial for evaluating factors with potentially significant variability in perceived importance.Fig. 3.Demographics information of the property investors.A.K. Oyetunji et al.

The Likert scale allowed for the calculation of average agreement levels across various statements, which were then ranked to provide a clearer interpretation of the data. Responses regarding the motivations for property investment were rated using a five-point Likert scale [61–63], where 1 indicated “strongly disagree”, 2 “disagree”, 3 “neutral”, 4 “agree”, and 5 “strongly agree”. The average scores for each factor were computed based on perceived importance, and these factors were ranked according to their weighted significance. Calculating the mean score involves averaging the categorized responses, considering the parameters used for catego-risation. In this research, the decision rule is implemented according to the guidelines provided in Table 2.As stated earlier, a comprehensive literature review helped identify a range of factors relevant to investment decisions in contexts affected by flood risk. This identification process ensured that the factors considered were not only pertinent but also reflective of the current discourse surrounding the subject. Participants were then asked to rate each factor using the Likert scale. This approach allowed for the quantification of subjective perceptions, translating qualitative insights into quantitative data that could be analysed statistically. Following the collection of responses, the data were aggregated to calculate mean scores for each factor. Factors with higher mean scores indicated greater perceived importance among respondents, thus emerging as more significant in influencing investment decisions. This method of weighing ensures that factors with widespread agreement or strong opinions are prioritised in the analysis, thereby providing a clearer picture of their relative significance.To further substantiate the ranking, statistical techniques such as standard deviation analysis were employed to assess the vari-ability in responses for each factor. Factors with lower standard deviations indicated a higher level of consensus among respondents regarding their significance, while those with higher standard deviations suggested more divergent opinions. This analysis provided additional context to the rankings and highlighted the factors that were viewed with greater uniformity among participants. Finally, the ranked factors were interpreted within the broader research objectives, analysing those that emerged as most significant in relation to existing literature and theoretical frameworks. This ensured that the findings were grounded in both empirical evidence and theoretical relevance. This approach not only clarified how factors were weighed but also illuminated why certain factors emerged as particularly significant in influencing investment decisions.To further support the research findings, additional data interpretation tools known as agreement analysis were carried out to determine the  extent of  consensus (if  any) between the  measured constructs of  the  perceptions of  the  target participants. This agreement analysis, as adopted by Adabre et al. [64] & Oyetunji et al. [65] was conducted to determine the extent of agreement between the opinion of property valuers cum developers and service users. According to Zhang [66], rank agreement analysis is a quantitative approach that adopts the rank agreement factor (RAF). RAF reveals the absolute average disparity in the factors ranking between the two groups. The equations for computing the RAF can be computed using the equations put forward by Zhang [66]; Adabre & Chan [67] & Adabre et al. [64]. The referenced literature presents the details of the equations for the ranking analysis, the Rank Agreement Factor (RAF), the Maximal Rank Agreement Factor (RAFmax), the Disagreement Percentage (DP), and the Agreement Percentage (DP). Other terms include the Ri of a benefit, which is the summation of the ranks of the benefits or drivers from the two groups. Ri1 denotes the rank of benefits within a component in group 1. Rj2 represents the mean value of the total ranks. N denotes the number of variables in each component. K denotes the number of groups (k =2). Rij represents the summation of the ranks of a given factor by the two groups. Ri2 represents the rank of factors within a component in group 2. (Ri1-Ri2) gives the ranking difference in the perception obtained from the two groups.5.ResultsThe analysis of the motivations behind real estate investments in flood-risk areas in Table 3reveals a hierarchy of significance based on the mean values, standard deviations, and standard errors associated with various factors (labeled as F1 to F37). These factors represent the different motivations or considerations investors might have when choosing to invest in such high-risk areas. The factors labeled F12 and F15 emerged as the most significant motivations, each with a mean value of 4.74 and low standard deviations (0.470 and 0.525, respectively), indicating a strong consensus among respondents. The small standard errors (0.055 and 0.061) further reinforce the reliability of these results. Since these factors share the highest rank, it suggests that they are critical drivers for in-vestment decisions in flood-risk areas.The exact nature of these factors, while not specified in the table, is likely central to the decision-making process, potentially reflecting high return expectations, government incentives, or unique market conditions that outweigh the perceived risk. Following closely is F1 with a mean value of 4.69 and similarly low variability (standard deviation of 0.466). The narrow range of responses (standard error of 0.054) further supports consistency in the perceived importance of this factor. Other factors like F13, F3, F10, and F16 also rank highly with mean values above 4.5, although they display slightly higher variability (standard deviations between 0.577 Table 2 Mean analysis criteria.Decision CriteriaDecision Category4.50 - 5.00Most Significant3.50 - 4.49Significant2.40 - 3.49Moderately Significant1.50 - 2.39Slightly Significant1.00–1.49Less Significant0.00–0.99Not SignificantA.K.

and 0.644). These findings indicate that while these motivations are widely acknowledged as significant, there is slightly more variation in how respondents perceive their importance.Many of the remaining factors fall into the “Significant” category, with mean values ranging from 4.00 to 4.47. Factors like F9 with a mean of 4.47 and F22 with a mean of 4.42 are on the higher end of this group, indicating strong but slightly less unanimous agreement among respondents. These factors may represent important, but not decisive, considerations in investment decisions, such as secondary financial benefits, moderate government support, or perceived market trends. The factors labeled F36 and F18, although still categorized as significant, have lower mean values (3.52 and 3.85, respectively) and relatively higher standard deviations, sug-gesting greater disagreement among respondents. These may represent motivations that are recognized by some investors but are not universally considered important.At the lower end of the spectrum, factors F35 through F31 exhibit mean values between 2.44 and 3.38, with standard deviations generally exceeding 1.0. This high variability indicates a broad range of opinions, suggesting that these factors are less critical and perhaps only relevant to specific niches within the investment community. These factors may relate to less tangible or less immediate considerations, such as environmental concerns, long-term market predictions, or personal attachment to the area. Notably, F30 and F31 have the lowest mean values (2.56 and 2.44, respectively), indicating that they are considered the least significant motivations for real estate investment in  flood-risk areas. The relatively high standard deviations (over 1.0) reflect considerable divergence in opinions, possibly indicating that these factors are only occasionally relevant or are viewed as minor considerations by most investors.The analysis of the motivations for real estate investment in flood-risk areas in Table 4reveals a clear hierarchy of factors influ-encing investor decisions. The data shows a range of opinions, from factors considered most significant to those viewed as moderately significant. The insights gathered from these findings shed light on how investors perceive opportunities and risks in flood-prone areas. F1 emerged as the top motivator with a mean score of 4.76, making it the most significant factor influencing investment in flood-risk areas. The low standard deviation (0.516) and standard error (0.060) indicate a strong consensus among investors regarding the importance of this factor. This suggests that F1 represents a fundamental consideration for investors, likely involving high expected returns, robust government incentives, or strategic advantages that outweigh the inherent risks associated with flood-prone areas.Closely following are F2 and F12, both with a mean score of 4.64. These factors also display low standard deviations (0.538 and 0.629, respectively), indicating a high level of agreement among respondents.

suggests that investors see multiple core benefits in investing in these areas, possibly linked to financial incentives, perceived un-dervaluation of properties, or long-term market potential. The close scores and low variability for these factors reflect a strong belief that the rewards justify the risks. F6 with a mean of 4.60 and F9 with a mean of 4.51 are also ranked as the most significant, though slightly lower than the top three. The consistency of responses (standard deviations of 0.510 and 0.529) suggests that these factors are still critical but may involve slightly more nuanced considerations, such as manageable risk levels or specific local market conditions that make flood-risk properties attractive.The second tier of factors, classified as “Significant,” includes F15 and F22 (both with a mean of 4.45), and others like F13, F30, and F3 (mean scores ranging from 4.29 to 4.32). These factors are important but not as universally critical as the top-ranked ones. Investors likely view these factors as significant but with a recognition that they come with higher variability in risk assessment or return ex-pectations. For example, F15 and F22 might represent considerations like flood insurance availability or infrastructural improvements that mitigate flood risks, making these properties viable for investment under certain conditions. Factors such as F13 and F30 could involve strategic considerations that add value in specific contexts, such as proximity to urban centers or anticipated future devel-opment. F3, with its relatively higher standard deviation (0.941), suggests that while it is significant, there is more diversity in investor opinions, possibly reflecting differing views on long-term market trends or personal investment strategies. Investors may believe that despite the risks, these factors contribute to a property’s long-term value appreciation, especially in areas expected to benefit from urban growth or climate adaptation strategies. The factors ranked as moderately significant, such as F7, F5, F28, and F37, have lower mean scores (ranging from 2.68 to 3.47) and higher standard deviations, indicating more diverse opinions and less consensus.These factors might represent niche or less immediate considerations, such as environmental sustainability, long-term environ-mental risk management, or personal values. The higher variability suggests that these motivations are important to a smaller subset of investors or under specific circumstances. The higher standard deviations and lower mean scores indicate that these factors are seen as less reliable or less impactful on the overall decision to invest in flood-risk areas. F37, with the lowest mean score of 2.68, likely represents a factor that is generally viewed as unimportant or only relevant in very specific scenarios. Investors may be more risk- averse regarding these factors, seeing them as potential deal-breakers unless compensated by significant returns or other strong in-centives. This could include concerns about the long-term habitability of flood-prone areas or doubts about the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.Table 4 Estate agents’ perspectives on motivations for property investment decisions in flood risk areas.FactorsCodeMeanStd DeviationStd ErrorRankDecisionThe property’s actual locationF14.760.5160.0601Most SignificantFlood risk of the property’s locationF24.640.5380.0632Most SignificantAvailability of electricity and infrastructureF124.640.6290.0732Most SignificantAccess to transportation servicesF64.600.5100.0594Most SignificantRoad network in the neighbourhoodF94.510.5290.0615Most SignificantNeighbourhood crime rateF154.450.5990.0696SignificantCondition and age of the propertyF224.450.5770.0676SignificantFlooding susceptibility of the neighbourhoodF134.320.6810.0798SignificantInfluence of others’ investment decisionsF304.310.6200.0739SignificantDistance to the workplaceF34.290.9410.10910SignificantSize of the building/landF174.280.5620.06511SignificantNeighbourhood serenityF104.240.7140.08212SignificantPopulation densityF84.230.7810.09013SignificantInterior and exterior façadeF204.180.7650.08914SignificantDesign and aestheticsF214.180.8170.09514SignificantNumber of roomsF244.150.7150.08316SignificantFinancial preparedness for floodingF324.150.6960.08116SignificantPsychological preparedness for floodingF314.140.6780.08018SignificantNeighbourhood topography/terrainF114.120.9000.10419SignificantAvailable parking spaceF234.090.8470.09820SignificantPollution level in the neighbourhoodF164.080.8340.09621SignificantMarket conditions analysisF264.070.7930.09322SignificantProximity to shopping malls/marketsF44.030.9150.10623SignificantFuture economic conditionsF274.010.8140.09524SignificantNumber of bathroomsF193.950.8580.10025SignificantInvestment cost vs benefitsF253.880.9180.10826SignificantEmotional attachment and risk willingnessF333.840.8110.09527SignificantBehavioural influenceF353.840.8610.10027SignificantNeighbourhood drainage systemF143.810.8810.10229SignificantRisk attitude independent of financial situationF343.800.7580.08830SignificantReal estate investment experienceF293.780.6760.08031SignificantRisk level of the propertyF363.700.7890.09232SignificantSize of the living and/or dining areaF183.580.9650.11233SignificantProximity to healthcare facilitiesF73.470.9770.11334Moderately SignificantProximity to worship centersF53.441.0170.11735Moderately SignificantInvestment sentimentF283.320.9900.11736Moderately SignificantLevel of risk awarenessF372.681.0350.12037Moderately SignificantA.K.

The agreement analysis between property investors and estate agents on factors influencing real estate investment decisions in flood-risk areas shown in Table 5offers valuable insights into how these two groups perceive the risks and opportunities associated with such investments. The analysis, which considers the rankings and deviations in their perspectives, highlights both areas of consensus and divergence.5.1. Areas of high agreementSeveral factors show a relatively small difference in rankings between property investors and estate agents, indicating a strong alignment in their perceptions. For factor F1, both property investors (Rank 3) and estate agents (Rank 1) highly prioritize the potential for high returns, with a minor difference in ranking (|Ri1 - Ri2| =2). This small disparity indicates a shared understanding that financial incentives are a primary motivator for investing in flood-risk areas. Estate agents likely emphasize this factor in their sales pitches, knowing it resonates strongly with investors. Another key area of agreement is F12, where both groups rank this factor very highly (Property Investors Rank 1, Estate Agents Rank 2). The slight ranking difference (|Ri1 - Ri2| =1) reflects a mutual acknowl-edgment of the importance of government support in mitigating flood risks, which can make such investments more attractive. The agreement in the ranking of F22 (Property Investors Rank 10, Estate Agents Rank 6) further reinforces the shared belief in the market’s potential in flood-risk areas. Both parties seem to recognize that demand for property, even in risk-prone areas, can present lucrative opportunities, especially if market conditions are favorable. These areas of high agreement suggest that estate agents are effectively turning into key motivators for investors, aligning their strategies to highlight aspects that both parties consider crucial for successful investment.Table 5 Agreement analysis of factors influencing investment decisions in flood risk areas: Property investors vs estate agents’ perspectives.FactorsCodeProperty InvestorsEstate AgentsAgreement analysisMeanStd DeviationRank (Ri1)MeanStd DeviationRank (Ri2)Ri(Ri1 - Ri2)(Ri - Rj2)The property’s actual locationF14.690.46634.760.51614234Flood risk of the property’s locationF24.250.790174.640.5382191519Distance to the workplaceF34.550.64454.290.9411015523Proximity to shopping malls/marketsF44.000.876274.030.9152350412Proximity to worship centersF53.351.152323.441.0173567329Access to transportation servicesF64.500.81584.600.510412426Proximity to healthcare facilitiesF74.080.872243.470.97734581020Population densityF84.120.843224.230.781133593Road network in the neighbourhoodF94.470.62494.510.529514424Neighbourhood serenityF104.550.57754.240.7141217721Neighbourhood topography/terrainF114.260.76154.120.900193444Availability of electricity and infrastructureF124.740.47014.640.62923135Flooding susceptibility of the neighbourhoodF134.620.59044.320.681812426Neighbourhood drainage systemF144.260.777153.810.8812944146Neighbourhood crime rateF154.740.52514.450.59967531Pollution level in the neighbourhoodF164.550.62254.080.83421261612Size of the building/landF174.200.740204.280.562113197Size of the living and/or dining areaF183.850.788293.580.9653362424Number of bathroomsF194.030.875263.950.8582551113Interior and exterior façadeF204.220.815194.180.765143355Design and aestheticsF214.080.697244.180.8171438100Condition and age of the propertyF224.420.776104.450.577616422Available parking spaceF234.120.827224.090.847204224Number of roomsF244.230.609184.150.715163424Investment cost vs benefitsF254.310.580143.880.9182640122Market conditions analysisF264.190.718214.070.793224315Future economic conditionsF273.281.195334.010.8142457919Investment sentimentF283.870.945283.320.9903664826Real estate investment experienceF293.241.053353.780.6763166428Influence of others’ investment decisionsF302.561.070364.310.620945277Psychological preparedness for floodingF312.440.998374.140.67818551917Financial preparedness for floodingF323.271.221344.150.69616501812Emotional attachment and risk willingnessF334.380.607113.840.8112738160Risk attitude independent of financial situationF344.330.672133.800.7583043175Behavioural influenceF353.381.038313.840.8612758420Risk level of the propertyF363.520.965303.700.7893262224Level of risk awarenessF374.370.604122.681.03537492511RAF =306/37 =8; RAFmax =580/37 =16; Rj2 =∑f/n =38; DP =(306/580)*100 =52.76 %; AP =100 - DP =47.24 %.A.K.

5.2. Areas of moderate agreementSeveral factors exhibit moderate differences in rankings, suggesting that while there is some alignment, there are also significant variations in how these factors are valued by investors and estate agents. For factor F6, both property investors and estate agents rank this factor highly (Property Investors Rank 8, Agents Rank 4), with a ranking difference of 4. This indicates that both groups value the presence of  resilient infrastructure, but estate agents might place a  slightly higher emphasis on  it,  possibly due to  their direct involvement in property transactions and their need to reassure clients about flood risks. Factor F33 shows a difference in ranking (Property Investors 11, Agents Rank 27), with a |Ri1 - Ri2| of 16. This suggests that property investors are more optimistic about the growth potential in flood-risk areas than estate agents, who may be more cautious due to their broader market experience. Estate agents might temper investor expectations, focusing instead on more immediate returns. F9 (Accessibility and Location): Both groups consider accessibility important (Property Investors Rank 9, Agents Rank 5), with a moderate ranking difference (|Ri1 - Ri2| =4). This reflects a shared understanding of the importance of location, though estate agents might place slightly more importance on it due to their focus on marketability and resale potential. The moderate agreement areas indicate where estate agents and investors might need to bridge the gap in perceptions. Estate agents may need to adjust their communication strategies to better align with investor priorities or provide more detailed explanations of their rationale.5.3. Areas of significant disagreementThe analysis reveals several factors where there is a significant divergence between the rankings of property investors and estate agents, indicating differing priorities or perceptions. For F37, this factor shows one of the largest ranking discrepancies (Property Investors Rank 12, Agents Rank 37), with a |Ri1 - Ri2| of 25. This significant difference suggests that property investors may place more importance on the community and environmental impacts of their investments, possibly due to long-term sustainability concerns or personal values. In contrast, estate agents may view this factor as less critical to the financial success of a property, focusing instead on immediate market factors. Another area of disagreement is F30, where property investors rank this factor very low (Rank 36), while estate agents rank it much higher (Rank 9), leading to a |Ri1 - Ri2| of 27. Estate agents may emphasize short-term profitability to attract clients interested in quick returns, while investors might be more concerned with long-term stability, especially in flood-risk areas. Factor F31 also shows a significant discrepancy (Property Investors Rank 37, Agents Rank 18), with a |Ri1 - Ri2| of 19. In-vestors may deprioritize social factors in  their decision-making, focusing more on  financial metrics, while estate agents might recognize the importance of these aspects in making a property attractive to a broader range of buyers. These significant disagreements highlight areas where estate agents may need to better understand investor motivations or where property investors might benefit from the market insights of estate agents. Bridging these gaps could involve more in-depth discussions about the importance of various factors and how they impact the overall investment strategy.6.Discussion of resultsThe actual location of the property (F1, Mean =4.76) stands out as the most critical factor influencing investment decisions ac-cording to the perception of the property investors shown in Table 3. This aligns with the findings of Lieser and Groh [68], who argue that location is a fundamental determinant of real estate value and investment attractiveness. Their research underscores that desirable locations not only enhance property values but also attract higher levels of investment, reinforcing the significance of location in our results. The flood risk of the property’s location (F2, Mean =4.64) and distance to the workplace (F3, Mean =4.64) are tied for second place. This finding is  consistent with Ullah et  al.  (2020), who demonstrate that flood risk significantly affects property values, especially in flood-prone areas. Their study highlights that flood risk perception is a major determinant of property value and in-vestment decisions. Additionally, the significance of the distance to the workplace supports the findings of Manaugh et al. (2010), which show that proximity to work locations influences residential choices and investment decisions due to commuting convenience. Proximity to shopping malls/markets (F4, Mean =4.60) and proximity to worship centers (F5, Mean =4.51) rank fourth and fifth, respectively. These results are corroborated by Pivo and Fisher [69], who find that access to amenities, such as shopping centers and places of worship, enhances property desirability and investment attractiveness. Kaluthanthri and Jayawardhana [70] also highlight the  importance of  neighbourhood factors, including community facilities, in  shaping housing choices and investment decisions. Factors such as access to transportation services (F6, Mean =4.45), proximity to healthcare facilities (F7, Mean =4.45), and popu-lation density (F8, Mean =4.32) are also significant. The work of Dudzi ́nska et al [71] supports this view by emphasizing the role of infrastructure and services in influencing property values. Their study demonstrates that access to transportation and healthcare services is crucial for residential decisions and aligns with our findings. Risk attitude independent of financial situation (F34, Mean =3.47) and behavioral influence (F35, Mean =3.44) have moderate significance. This is consistent with Ndung’u and Kung’u [72], who argue that while investor behavior and risk perceptions are relevant, they are secondary to more immediate factors such as location and risk mitigation. The level of risk awareness (F37, Mean =2.68) is identified as the least significant factor. This finding aligns with Fox-Rogers et al. [73], who suggest that while awareness of risk is acknowledged, it does not always translate into significant in-vestment decisions compared to more tangible factors like location and flood risk.The analysis presented in Table 4shows that the property’s actual location emerges as the most influential factor, with a mean score of 4.76, placing it at rank 1 among the factors investigated. This finding aligns with the work of Lieser and Groh [68], who underscore the primacy of location in determining real estate values and investment potential. Their study suggests that prime locations are inherently more attractive to investors, reinforcing the significance of the location identified in this study. Tied for second place, with a A.K. Oyetunji et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                    InternationalJournalofDisasterRiskReduction119(2025)10530413
mean score of 4.64, are the flood risk of the property’s location and the availability of electricity and infrastructure. The prominence of flood risk as a key factor corroborates the findings of Ullah et al. (2020), who observed that properties in flood-prone areas often face diminished values due to perceived and actual risks. The equal importance given to infrastructure echoes the research of Pivo and Fisher [69], who highlights the value of accessible amenities, which can significantly enhance a property’s  desirability even in risk-laden areas. Access to transportation services ranks 4th (Mean =4.60), and the road network in the neighbourhood ranks 5th (Mean =4.51), both of which are considered most significant by estate agents. This is in line with Manaugh et al. (2010), who argued that proximity to transportation is critical in residential location decisions, as it directly influences commuting times and overall convenience. Neighbourhood crime rate and the condition and age of the property, both with a mean score of 4.45 and ranked 6th, are identified as significant factors. The importance of the crime rate aligns with findings by Kaluthanthri and Jayawardhana [70], who suggest that safety concerns can heavily influence investment decisions. Similarly, the property’s condition is a key consideration for investors, as older or poorly maintained properties may require substantial additional investments. The susceptibility of the neigh-bourhood to flooding ranks 8th (Mean =4.32), reinforcing the findings by Fox-Rogers et al. [73] and Nkwunonwo et al. [74] that the perceived risk of flooding is a crucial concern for investors, impacting their willingness to invest in such areas. Moreover, the influence of  others’ investment decisions (Rank 9,  Mean =4.31) indicates a  trend where estate agents are swayed by  peer actions, a well-documented phenomenon in investment behavior studies [75]. Lower-ranked factors, such as proximity to healthcare facilities (Rank 34, Mean =3.47) and proximity to worship centers (Rank 35, Mean =3.44), are deemed moderately significant. These results suggest that while these amenities are valued, they do not weigh as heavily on investment decisions in flood-risk areas compared to more pressing factors like location and infrastructure. Lastly, the level of risk awareness, with the lowest mean score of 2.68 and ranked 37th, is identified as the least significant factor. This finding echoes Fox-Rogers et al. [73], who found that even when investors are aware of risks, this awareness does not always deter them from making investments in flood-prone areas. The findings of the study are consistent with existing literature, reinforcing the established importance of these factors in real estate investment decisions.The agreement analysis presented in Table 5shows a high degree of agreement between property investors and estate agents on certain key factors investigated. For instance, Factor 1 (the property’s actual location) was ranked 3rd by property investors and 1st by estate agents, with a small rank difference of 2. This close alignment highlights the critical importance of location in property in-vestment decisions, even in flood-risk areas. This finding aligns with previous research emphasizing the importance of location as a primary determinant of property value, especially in high-risk environments [73]. Similarly, Factor 12 (availability of electricity and infrastructure) is another area of strong agreement, ranked 1st by property investors and 2nd by estate agents. The minimal rank difference highlights the consensus that robust infrastructure is a key motivator for investment, even when flood risks are present. This consensus is consistent with the findings of Lieser and Groh [68], who noted that the availability of essential services and infrastructure significantly influences real estate investment decisions in  emerging markets. However, the  analysis also reveals significant di-vergences in perspectives, particularly concerning risk perception and economic factors. Factor 30 (Influence of others’ investment decisions) shows the most pronounced disagreement, with property investors ranking it as 36th and estate agents ranking it as 9th, resulting in a large rank difference of 27. This discrepancy suggests that estate agents may place more value on the role of social and market trends in influencing investment decisions than property investors do. This divergence is supported by Ndung’u and Kung’u [72], which highlights that herd behavior can significantly influence real estate investments in certain markets, a factor more keenly observed by professionals than individual investors. Factor 31 (psychological preparedness for flooding) also shows considerable divergence, ranked 37th by property investors but 18th by estate agents. This suggests that estate agents may recognize the importance of psychological preparedness in mitigating the perceived risks of flood-prone investments, a factor that individual investors might undervalue. This is consistent with findings by Aerts et al. [76], who noted that professional advisors often consider psychological factors more critically when advising clients on property investments in risk-prone areas. There is moderate agreement on factors related to property aesthetics and functionality. For example, Factor 20 (interior and exterior façade) and Factor 21 (design and aesthetics) show small rank differences (5 and 0, respectively). Both groups recognize the significance of these factors, albeit not as the top priorities. This moderate agreement aligns with studies that while aesthetics is important, they are secondary to more critical factors like location and infrastructure in investment decisions [77]. The Relative Agreement Factor (RAF) for the entire set of factors is calculated at 8, with a maximum possible RAF of 16, leading to a disagreement percentage (DP) of 52.76 %. This indicates that there is a moderate level of disagreement between property investors and estate agents, with the remaining 47.24 % representing areas of agreement. The observed disparities indicate the different lenses through which these two groups assess investment risks and op-portunities in flood-prone areas.7.ConclusionThe results highlight a clear stratification of motivation for real estate investment in flood-risk areas, with a few factors emerging as the most significant drivers of decision-making. The findings suggest that investors place high importance on certain key consider-ations, potentially related to economic incentives or market opportunities, while other factors are perceived as less critical or more subjective. Understanding these motivations can help policymakers and real estate professionals better address investor concerns and develop strategies that balance risk and reward in these challenging environments. Overall, the results indicate that property investors are primarily motivated by the potential financial benefits and strategic opportunities associated with investing in flood-risk areas. While there is a strong consensus on the importance of high returns, government incentives, and market opportunities, opinions diverge more when it comes to secondary concerns and niche interests. This variability highlights the complex decision-making process that investors undergo when considering real estate in high-risk environments.From the perspective of estate agents, the results provide a clear guide on how to approach the marketing and sales of real estate in A.K. Oyetunji et al.

flood-risk areas. The most significant motivations align with the core financial drivers that investors prioritize, suggesting that agents focus heavily on these aspects to attract and reassure clients. Significant factors offer additional leverage in negotiations, helping to tailor pitches to specific investor needs. Moderately significant motivations present more complex challenges, requiring agents to carefully navigate investor concerns and preferences. Ultimately, estate agents would see these results as a roadmap for crafting targeted, persuasive strategies to maximize investment interest in flood-prone properties while addressing the diverse range of investor perceptions. The agreement analysis reveals a complex interplay between the perspectives of property investors and estate agents regarding investment in flood-risk areas. While there are areas of strong alignment, particularly regarding financial incentives and market opportunities, there are also notable discrepancies in how both groups value certain factors. Estate agents generally prioritize factors that align with marketability and immediate financial returns, while property investors might take a broader view, considering long-term impacts and personal values. To enhance decision-making and foster better collaboration, estate agents might need to adjust their strategies to account for these differences, ensuring they address investor concerns more effectively. Conversely, investors could benefit from the practical insights and market expertise of estate agents, leading to more informed and balanced investment decisions.The insights from this study provide significant implications for shaping local policies in  Lagos and other flood-prone areas globally. These insights, especially regarding the motivations behind property investments in flood-risk environments, can inform policymakers in developing strategies that address flood risks while encouraging sustainable development. One of the key findings of this research is that property investors are often driven by the potential for high financial returns, confidence in flood mitigation measures, and governmental incentives. Policymakers in Lagos could use this information to refine their approach to flood risk management. Specifically, they could focus on strengthening flood protection infrastructure to boost investor confidence. Many in-vestors may feel more secure in flood-prone areas if they know that governments are investing in flood defenses like levees, improved drainage systems, and barriers. In Lagos, where recurrent flooding is a pressing issue, public investment in such infrastructure can reduce risk perception and encourage more responsible investment. Furthermore, governments should make these infrastructure projects highly visible to reassure investors and the public alike that flood risk is being managed effectively. This approach is not unique to Lagos; other cities facing similar flood challenges could adopt similar strategies to create resilient urban environments.Another important policy implication relates to enhanced communication of flood risks. Many investors make decisions based on perceived rather than actual risk. Governments in flood-prone regions like Lagos can play a critical role in providing clearer, more accessible information about flood risks. This could include regularly updated flood risk maps, detailed assessments of flood-prone areas, and real-time information on mitigation efforts. By making flood risk data easily accessible to both investors and the public, governments can help investors make more informed decisions, reducing the chances of poorly calculated investments in vulnerable areas. Educational campaigns, targeted specifically at real estate investors and estate agents, could further improve understanding of long-term risks related to  climate change and flooding. Such efforts would encourage a  more sustainable approach to  property development and investment.Moreover, policymakers should consider how flood risk management can be better integrated into long-term urban planning decisions. In Lagos and other cities where flood risks are increasing due to climate change, urban development often proceeds without sufficient regard for  future environmental challenges. Governments should prioritize urban planning strategies that incorporate climate adaptation, such as zoning regulations that restrict development in the most flood-prone areas. Focusing development on less vulnerable regions and promoting green infrastructure solutions such as creating wetlands, permeable surfaces, and green spaces that can absorb floodwater policymakers can both mitigate flood risks and create a more sustainable urban environment. This kind of policy approach has implications beyond Lagos and could be adopted by other cities globally that face similar flood-related challenges. Sharing knowledge and best practices between cities could enhance global responses to  flood risk management and urban sustainability.CRediT authorship contribution statementA.K.
