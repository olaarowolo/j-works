This study explores the efficacy of boron modification in mitigating nickel-induced deactivation across three zeolite types (Y-5.1, USY-5.2 and VUSY-12) with variable silica-to-alumina ratios. Nickel was introduced at 30 wt% con-centration, while boron loadings ranged from 1 to 10 wt%. The boron-modified zeolites showed a recovery in crystallinity, with increases from 43 % to 93 % at 10 wt% boron. Pyridine-FTIR demonstrated that the intro-duction of boron enhanced the Bronsted acidity of the nickel-deactivated zeolites. Hydrogen Temperature Pro-grammed Reduction (H2-TPR) showed a shift in NiO reduction temperatures from 450–500 ◦C to 600–700◦C upon boron addition, indicating the formation of stronger acid sites. The catalytic performance tests showed that addition of boron effectively suppressed the formation of hydrogen and methane during the catalytic cracking of n-heptane and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB), demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse effects of nickel contamination. Boron modification led to a reduction in hydrogen yield by 30 % for Y-5.1, 56 % for USY-5.2, and 57 % for VUSY-12 during n-heptane cracking. For TIPB cracking, the corresponding reductions in hydrogen production were 22 %, 56 %, and 45 % for Y-5.1, USY-5.2 and VUSY-12, respectively. The level of the enhancement depends on zeolite types and silica-to-alumina ratios. These results suggest that boron enhances the structural stability of zeolite catalysts and mitigates the dehydrogenation effects of nickel, promoting improved performance in RFCC applications.1. IntroductionThe recent shift towards catalytic conversion of heavy crude oil, petroleum residues, and bio-based feedstocks has prompted the devel-opment of the residue fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) process to address the limitations of traditional fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). While con-ventional FCC relies majorly on the feed from the bottom of the vacuum distillation unit, RFCC directly processes the heavy and contaminated residues from the crude distillation unit into lighter and more valued petroleum products like olefins, cracked gasoline, Light Cycle Oil (LCO), and Heavy Cycle Oil (HCO).Indeed, implementing RFCC eliminates the need to establish and operate a  separate vacuum distillation unit,  thereby reducing costs. However, processing the dense and contaminated residues from the at-mospheric distillation unit, as  well  as  biomass feedstocks, poses numerous challenges owing to the presence of heteroatom contaminants such  as  V,  Ni,  Na,  Fe  and  high  Conradson Carbon Residues (CCR). Among these, Ni is particularly detrimental as it catalyses side reactions, for example, dehydrogenation and excessive coke formation, thereby deactivating the RFCC catalyst.Nickel compounds, such as porphyrins and naphthenates, have the potential to accumulate on the cracking catalysts during the cracking process. Within the regenerator, these compounds undergo oxidation, yielding NiO as one of the resultant products. NiO undergoes reduction to its elemental form, nickel (Ni0), upon entry into the reactor riser. This elemental nickel serves as an active dehydrogenation site, facilitating the generation of surplus hydrogen and coke, consequently limiting selectivity to the desired product [1–3]. Moreover, the deposition of nickel oxide and metallic nickel can block pores and reduce the acces-sibility of active sites, leading to a loss of crystallinity.In our recent article [4], we provided a detailed investigation into the effects of nickel deactivation on various zeolites (Y-5.1, USY-5.2 and *Corresponding author at: Research and Development Centre, Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals, FZE, Union Marble House, Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria.E-mail address: daniel.adanenche@dangoteprojects.com(D.E.

VUSY-12), examining their crystallinity, surface area, pore structure, morphology, acidity, and catalytic performance under varying nickel loadings. The  study revealed that  higher nickel concentrations (20–30 wt%) led to the detection of nickel oxide (NiO) phases, reduced crystallinity, and potential structural degradation. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption showed mesoporous characteristics, with VUSY-12 maintaining better pore accessibility at low Ni loadings due to its hierarchical structure but experiencing significant pore blockage at 30 wt% Ni. Morphological analyses indicated uniform zeolite particles at 0 wt% Ni, transitioning to NiO-induced agglomeration at higher Ni loadings. NH3-TPD revealed diminished acid site strength and quantity with increased Ni, particularly in VUSY-12, impacting catalytic effi-ciency by favouring dehydrogenation over hydrocarbon cracking. Cat-alytic cracking tests  with n-Heptane confirmed shifts in  product distribution, favouring light alkanes and olefins alongside increase in the yield of hydrogen and methane as Ni loading increased, with Y-5.1 showing the  best  catalytic performance. The  work underscored the detrimental impact of  nickel on  zeolite structure and  functionality, highlighting the need for strategies to mitigate Ni-induced degradation in hydrocarbon cracking applications.There have been efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of nickel in zeolites-Y based catalysts used for the catalytic cracking of hydrocar-bons. BASF, a leading manufacturer of cracking catalysts, carried out a comparative analysis of catalysts with nickel passivation versus those without. Their findings showed that the application of antimony for passivation increased NOx production by 20 % [5]. The increase was as a result of the presence of antimony within the cracking environment, which may change the conversion pathways of nitrogen compounds, thereby enabling the production of NOx precursors such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or ammonia (NH₃). Inside the regenerator, these pre-cursors are oxidized to NOx instead of being completely reduced to ni-trogen gas  (N₂).  Moreover, it  was  observed that  antimony presents considerable handling hazards and  can  contribute to  the  fouling of processing equipment [6]. Substitute materials, such as silica-doped aluminas, lanthanum, and phosphorus have also been used by refiners to offset the detrimental effects of nickel [6–8]. For example, research by Yue et al. [7]observed the efficacy of mesoporous silica-doped aluminas in nickel passivation. Nonetheless, it was determined that alumina’s effectiveness is reduced under RFCC conditions due to its high periph-eral deposition index, which limits its mobility within the system [9].New studies have underscored the potential of boron as an effective passivator, due to its outstanding capacity to decrease dehydrogenation and prevent coke formation [10–13]. For example, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to examine the influence of boron on the surface of cobalt, indicating that boron mimics carbon adsorption by occupying octahedral sites in the first subsurface layer of the metal. The selective occupation impedes the diffusion of carbon into the metal lattice, thereby reducing the formation of both hydrogen and carbon species [10]. Over the past few decades, the effects of boron on Al₂O₃--supported nickel catalysts have been extensively studied. For example, the modification of a 15 % Ni/Al₂O₃ catalyst with 1 % boron resulted in an 80 % reduction in dehydrogenation and carbon deposition during methane steam reforming [12].  In  another investigation, a boron-modified nickel catalyst was  utilized for  the  Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, where boron addition reduced the rate of catalyst deactiva-tion by a factor of six without compromising catalytic activity [11]. More recently, it has been shown that incorporating boron into Ni/Al₂O₃ catalysts diminishes dehydrogenation and regulates the size of nickel particles [13].The  aforementioned studies indicate that  boron can  effectively inhibit hydrogen and carbon formation on catalyst surfaces. However, no comprehensive study has explored the synergistic effects of boron and nickel on high-surface-area mesoporous zeolites across a wide range of concentrations, particularly for the catalytic cracking of light and heavy petroleum feedstocks. n-Heptane and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) were chosen as model feedstocks for their distinct structural and  chemical traits, offering complementary insights into  catalytic performance. n-Heptane, a linear alkane, represents a class of light hy-drocarbons prone to cracking and dehydrogenation, making it an ideal candidate for evaluating the acid site strength and distribution in zeo-lites. TIPB, an aromatic compound with bulky substituents, serves as a representative heavy feedstock that challenges the accessibility and ef-ficacy of active sites within the catalyst’s porous architecture. Together, these feedstocks enable a comprehensive assessment of catalytic activity under varying reaction conditions and feed complexities, reflecting the practical diversity encountered in  RFCC processes. Further in-vestigations are needed to provide additional insight into boron’s role in mitigating nickel’s  deleterious effects. Therefore, this  work aims  to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of varying boron loadings on three different nickel-deactivated zeolites: zeolite-Y (Y-5.1), ultra-stable Y  (USY-5.2) and  very-ultra-stable Y  (VUSY-12) in  the cracking of  n-Heptane and  1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene. The  principal focus of this research is to explore the physicochemical interactions amongst boron, nickel, and  the  zeolite framework. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and pyridine Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) are the characterisation techniques that  will  be  used  to  study the  physico-chemical changes in the zeolites caused by the deposition of boron and nickel. Moreover, the catalytic activities of the modified zeolites will be assessed using both light and heavy hydrocarbon feedstocks.2. Experimental2.1.Zeolite preparationThe impact of boron on the nickel-induced deactivation of zeolite catalysts was  studied using three separate zeolite substrates distin-guished by their silica to alumina ratios: zeolite-Y, ultra-stable-Y (USY), and  very-ultra-stable-Y (VUSY). The  deposition of  nickel onto  each zeolite was done at a concentration of 30 wt% using the procedure established by Adanenche et al. [4]. Precisely, the zeolite samples un-derwent calcination at 650◦C for 5 h to remove ammonia and change the ammonium form of the zeolites into their hydrogen form. Afterward, nickel was added to the zeolites through the wet impregnation process. The process involved preparing a 30 wt% nickel solution by dissolving nickel naphthenate (C22H14NiO4,  containing approximately 10  % nickel) in cyclohexane (C6H12, of analytical reagent grade). A similar procedure was  used  for  the  boron impregnation of  the  resulting Ni/zeolites, utilising boric acid as the boron source. Boron was deposited onto the Ni/zeolites at concentrations of 1, 3, 7, and 10 wt% by dis-solving the suitable amount of boric acid in water. The zeolites were slowly added to the solutions while continuously stirring at a rate of 3 rpm, maintaining a temperature of 90◦C until all the solvent evapo-rated, resulting in a viscous substance. The resultant viscous materials were then dried in an oven at 100◦C for 24 h and calcined in a muffle furnace at 650◦C for 5 h.2.2.Zeolite characterisationThe procedure for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was adapted from previous studies [4], Precisely, a Rigaku MiniFlex 6 G system was used with CuKα radiation (1.540593 Å) as the X-ray source. 2 g of powdered samples were compressed into  sample holders to  ensure uniformity. It was then scanned across a 2θ range of 2–70◦with a 0.02◦step  size,  and  analysed using the  STUDIO SMART LAB  II  software alongside ICDD PDF-4 databases.The ATR-FTIR analysis was conducted following the methodology outlined in a previous article [4]. Spectra were collected using a Cary 630 Agilent FTIR spectrometer within the 650–4000 cm⁻¹ range at a resolution of 8 cm⁻¹ . For analysis, powdered samples were pressed onto the  ATR  crystal to  ensure optimal contact. For  pyridine (Py)-FTIR analysis, samples were degassed at 250◦C for 2 h, exposed to pyridine D.E. Adanenche et al.

under vacuum for 3 h, and subsequently analysed via ATR-FTIR.Hydrogen-Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR) technique was used to assess the hydrogen reducibility of the zeolite samples on a Micromeritics Auto Chem 2920 apparatus. 50 mg of the sample was subjected to pre-treatment with argon gas at a flow rate of 32 mL per minute for one hour at 500◦C, followed by cooling to 100◦C in the same gas atmosphere. Afterward, the gas flow was changed to a mixture of 10 % hydrogen and argon at a rate of 50 cm³ at standard temperature and pressure (STP) per minute. The H2-TPR experiment was carried out within a temperature range of 100–800◦C, with a ramping rate of 10◦C per minute. Thermal conductivity detector was used to monitor the hydrogen consumption during the H2-TPR process.2.3.Zeolite testingThe procedure used for catalytic cracking was adapted from previous research [4].  Fixed-bed micro-activity test  (MAT) unit  was  used  to conduct the reactions involving n-Heptane and 1,3,5-triisopropylben-zene  under atmospheric pressure, employing nitrogen as  a  diluent. Preceding the catalytic tests, the reactor bed was conditioned under a nitrogen flow of 400 mL/min at 550◦C for two hours. The same condi-tions (550◦C, atmospheric pressure, 1-h residence time) was used to perform thermal cracking to establish a baseline for catalytic perfor-mance. The experiment involving catalytic cracking utilised 0.5 g of catalyst mixed with 1 g of glass beads and packed into the reactor, with n-Heptane and  1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene introduced at  a  rate  of 4 mL/min by a peristaltic pump, while maintaining a nitrogen flow of 400  mL/min. The  reactor outlet was  directed into  a  condenser for product collection. The resulting condensed liquid products were ana-lysed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled with an Agi-lent 5977 A mass selective detector (MSD). The system was equipped with an DB-624 capillary column (30 m ×0.25 mm ID ×0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies). The GC was operated in splitless in-jection mode with helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 1 μL using an Agilent G4513A autosampler, and the inlet temperature was set at 250◦C. The column oven temper-ature program was as follows: Initial temperature of 40◦C, held for 2 minutes, first ramp of 10 ◦C/min to 150◦C, held for 3 minutes, second ramp of 20 ◦C/min to 280◦C, held for 5 minutes. The total runtime for each sample was 28 minutes. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV. The ion source temperature was set to 230◦C, with the quadrupole temperature maintained at 150◦C. Data were collected in full scan mode over a mass range of 40–550 m/z. A solvent delay of 3 minutes was applied to prevent contamination of the mass spectrometer by the solvent. Uncondensed gases were channelled to a Gas Board gas analyser to monitor hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4).3. Results and discussion3.1.XRD of the nickel and boron-modified zeolites-YThree nickel-deactivated zeolites, Y-5.1, USY-5.2, and  VUSY-12 containing 30 wt% nickel each were subjected to boron impregnation to  assess the  efficacy of boron in  mitigating the detrimental effects associated with nickel deactivation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pat-terns of the boron-modified zeolites (Ni/B-zeolites) are presented in Fig. 1. Notably, the XRD analysis revealed that the boron-modified ze-olites retained the characteristic diffraction peaks of Y-zeolites, indi-cating the  preservation of  the  crystalline framework post-boron modification, as  observed in  previous studies [14].  An  important observation from the XRD data is the noticeable increase in diffraction intensities of  the  boron-modified zeolites in  relation to  their nickel-deactivated counterparts. The increase in intensity suggests an increase in  crystallinity attributable to  the  incorporation of  boron, which is quantitatively supported by the calculated percent relative crystallinities (RC). For example, as presented in Fig. 1a, the RC of the Y-5.1 sample increased from 43 % to a remarkable 93 % as boron con-centrations increased. The same trend was noted for the USY-5.2 and VUSY-12 samples, further supporting the notion that boron modification positively impacts the structural integrity of the zeolite framework. The observed improvement in crystallinity with increase in boron concen-trations may be connected with the formation of boron oxide (B2O3) species [15], as shown by the appearance of diffraction peaks corre-sponding to B2O3 at a 2θ Bragg’s angle of 28◦, as presented in Fig. 1. The intensity of these B2O3 diffraction peaks correlates positively with boron concentration, suggesting that  the  presence of  boron stabilises the zeolite structure andmay also facilitate the formation of additional crystalline phases.

Adanenche et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          NextMaterials8(2025)1007073
Moreover, the observed improvement in crystallinity with increase in boron concentrations may also be attributed to the formation of nickel borates (NiB2O4) as reported in previous studies [16]This explains the preserved crystalline framework post-boron modification as  earlier observed. These findings underscore the potential of boron as a modi-fying agent to mitigate the adverse effects of nickel deactivation in zeolite catalysts, thereby enhancing their performance in  catalytic applications.3.2.Pyridine-FTIR of boron-modified zeolites-YThe FTIR spectra of Pyridine (Py)-adsorbed zeolites are shown in Fig. 2. The bands at 1452 and 1543 cm1 are assigned to the Lewis and Bronsted acid sites, respectively, while the band at 1490 cm1 indicates Bronsted plus Lewis acid sites [17,18]. Because the Bronsted acid site is responsible for hydrogen transfer reactions and due to its dominant role in  cracking reactions [19],  the  bands at  1543 cm1 were  carefully compared. The FTIR spectra showed that the intensities of the bands increased with an increase in boron concentration. This suggests that modifying the nickel-deactivated zeolites with boron tends to increase the quantity of the Bronsted acid sites as depicted by the mechanism in Eq. 6. This observation may be because when boron is introduced into the zeolite, it substitutes the aluminum species in the zeolite framework. This boron substitution can alter the electronic properties of the zeolite in the sense that boron is less electronegative than aluminium, which means that boron-containing sites may have a higher proton density than aluminium-containing sites. This increased proton density can lead to stronger proton donating ability, enhancing Bronsted acidity and improving catalytic activity [20,21].Moreover, due to the electronegativity of boron and its ability to form strong bonds with oxygen, boron can stabilize the proton sites associated with Brønsted acidity. The boron-oxygen bond within the framework is less polarizable than the silicon-oxygen bond, making the protons more localized and easier to access for catalytic reactions [22]. This leads to stronger and more stable Brønsted acid sites, which can enhance catalytic activity, particularly for  reactions that  rely  on hydrogen transfer mechanisms, such as cracking.Table 1further confirmed the improvement in Bronsted acidity with increased boron concentration. For example, it could be observed that before nickel deactivation, Y-5.1 possessed 1768 μmol/g of Bronsted acidity, which drastically reduced to 1097 μmol/g upon deactivation with 30 wt% Ni. Modification with 1, 3, 7 and 10 wt% boron improved the Bronsted acidity with increased boron concentration. However, only 10 wt% B restored the Bronsted acidity to 1320 μmol/g above the nickel- deactivated value for Y-5.1. The same trend could be observed for USY- 5.2, except for every increment in boron concentration, the quantity of Bronsted acid  sites  improved above the  nickel-deactivated USY-5.2. Interestingly, VUSY-12 exhibited a different behaviour. For all boron concentrations, the  Bronsted acidity is  even  better than  the  parent zeolite before deactivation with 30 wt% Ni. It may be due to the rela-tively high mesoporosity of that zeolite, facilitating easy migration of the boron into the pores to substitute the aluminum species in the zeolite framework.The number of acid sites as presented in Table 1was determined using pyridine-FTIR spectroscopy. Pyridine was  adsorbed onto  the zeolite samples, and  the  intensities of  the  characteristic bands at 1452 cm⁻¹ (Lewis acid sites) and 1543 cm⁻¹ (Brønsted acid sites) were measured. The amount of pyridine adsorbed was quantified using cali-bration curves, and the acid site concentrations were calculated based on the integrated areas of these bands. The total acid sites were obtained by summing the Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. This method is well- established in the literature for quantifying acid sites in zeolites.3.3.H2-TPR of boron-modified zeolites-YThe results of the hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2- TPR) analysis for the nickel-supported zeolites (Ni/zeolites) and boron- modified nickel-supported zeolites (Ni/B-zeolites) are  presented in Fig. 3. The reduction of nickel oxide (NiO) in the Ni/zeolite samples is characterized by distinct peaks observed within the temperature range of 450–500◦C. This observation indicates the thermal reduction of NiO to metallic nickel under the applied hydrogen atmosphere. In contrast, the Ni/B-zeolite samples exhibit a notable shift in the reduction tem-peratures of NiO to higher values, with peaks occurring at elevated and Fig.  2.Pyridine (Py)-FTIR of:  (a)  Y-5.1, (b)  USY-5.2, and  (c)  VUSY-12 at varying boron concentrations.D.E. Adanenche et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          NextMaterials8(2025)1007074
more stable temperatures as the boron concentration increased. Pre-cisely, the reduction temperatures for NiO in the presence of boron were found to range from 600 to 700◦C at boron loadings of 7 and 10 wt%. The observed reduction temperature may be due to the formation of highly stable nickel borate species, predominantly NiB2O4,  which significantly impedes the reduction of NiO. The exceptional passivation effect of  boron-modified zeolites on  nickel species is  a  key  factor contributing to this stabilisation, as buttressed by the findings of Yuan et al. [14]. The significances of these results are particularly important in the context of the Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) process. This is  because, observed reduction temperatures for  the  boron-modified zeolites exceed the operational temperatures typically used in RFCC units, suggesting that the reduction of NiO will be considerably impeded when processing feedstocks with nickel concentrations as high as 30 wt %.  This  finding suggests that  the  incorporation of  boron into nickel-deactivated zeolite matrices is an effective strategy to alleviate the reduction of nickel species, thereby improving the stability and longevity of the catalyst in RFCC applications.3.4.Catalytic performances of the nickel and boron-modified zeolitesThe product distribution resulting from the catalytic cracking of n- heptane over the boron-modified catalysts is depicted in Fig. 4with the detailed individual compounds presented in Tables A 1, A 2, and A 3 of the supplementary materials. It is evident that there was a negligible change in the yield of C5–C6 alkanes and olefins as boron concentration increased. However, increasing boron concentration was observed with a concomitant rise in the abundance of heavier hydrocarbons (C7+). This phenomenon may be attributed to the decreased yield of hydrogen gas, leading to the formation of heavier hydrocarbon products.The catalytic influence of boron is further reflected in the distribu-tion  patterns of  hydrogen and  methane. A  progressive decline in hydrogen and methane production was noted as boron concentration increased. This  finding highlights boron’s  capability to  passivate nickel’s dehydrogenation activity, thereby reducing gaseous product formation and preserving the yield of light alkanes and olefins, which are crucial constituents of gasoline blends. Additionally, at a constant boron concentration across the three zeolites, the reduction in light al-kanes, olefins, hydrogen, and  methane followed the  sequence Y- 5.1>USY-5.2>VUSY-12. This  trend correlates with  the  increasing silica-to-alumina ratios in the aforementioned order, aligning with the distribution of acid sites as elucidated by the NH3-TPD study reported by Adanenche et al.

3.5.Catalytic performances of the Nickel and boron-modified zeolites on Heavier FeedstockThe catalytic cracking of a heavier model feedstock 1,3,5-Tri-isopro-pylbenzene (TIPB) was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor to assess the catalytic efficacy of zeolites loaded with 30 wt% nickel and 10 wt% boron. Fig.  5illustrates the  product distribution derived from  this cracking process with the detailed individual compounds presented in Tables A 4 of the supplementary materials. Notably, principal products of TIPB cracking include di-isopropyl benzene (DIPB) isomers, isopropyl benzene (IPB), and benzene. As depicted in Fig. 5, the VUSY-12 zeolite yields a higher proportion of DIPB, while the formation of deep cracking products, such as IPB and benzene, is minimal. This contrasts with the performance of Y-5.1 and USY-5.2, where a more significant proportion of  deep  cracking products is  observed relative to  VUSY-12. These findings suggest that the mesoporous structure of VUSY-12 facilitates the  production of  DIPB, likely due  to  the  contribution of  abundant mesopores to the initial cracking of TIPB. Furthermore, the mesopores in VUSY-12 enhance mass transfer efficiency for the bulky TIPB molecules, providing a pathway for initial cracking into intermediate-sized mole-cules, which can subsequently undergo further cracking within the ze-olites’ micropores.The distributions of hydrogen and methane during the cracking of n- heptane and 1,3,5-tri-isopropylbenzene over Y-5.1, USY-5.2, and VUSY- 12  zeolites, each  containing 30 wt%  nickel and  10 wt%  boron, are presented in Table 2. Notably, hydrogen and methane production are higher for n-heptane compared to TIPB across all zeolites at identical nickel and boron concentrations. This disparity can be attributed to the tendency of n-heptane to lose hydrogen atoms more readily due to the presence of  hydrogen atoms bonded to  sp3-hybridized carbons.

Conversely, 1,3,5-Tri-isopropylbenzene, with its three isopropyl sub-stituents, is an aromatic compound whose resonance-stabilized aromatic ring confers inherent stability.The  dehydrogenation of  aromatic compounds is inherently more difficult than alkanes because it would require breaking the aromatic stability. The isopropyl groups attached to the benzene ring contribute minimally to dehydrogenation because the aromatic ring is already in a stable state and is not significantly altered by such reactions. Conse-quently, the simpler structure and higher reactivity of n-heptane render it more susceptible to dehydrogenation in the presence of these catalysts compared to TIPB. This rationale elucidates the lower hydrogen and methane production observed during TIPB  cracking, as  detailed in Table 2.Furthermore, the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework resulted in  a  marked reduction in  hydrogen production during the Fig. 5.Product distribution of 1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene cracking over: (a) Y-5.1, (b) USY-5.2 and (c) VUSY-12 at 30 wt% Ni and 10 wt% boron.Table 2 Hydrogen and methane distribution of Y-5.1, USY-5.2 and VUSY-12 at 30 wt% Ni and 10 wt% B.CatalystH2CH4n-Heptane1,3,5-TIPBn-Heptane1,3,5-TIPBY5.1 30 wt% Ni9.897.297.026.53USY5.2 30 wt% Ni8.936.816.875.06VUSY12 30 wt% Ni8.434.935.774.94Y5.1 10 wt% B6.955.654.864.08USY5.2 10 wt% B3.913.013.683.24VUSY12 10 wt% B3.612.722.861.98D.E.

catalytic cracking of n-heptane and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB), demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse effects of nickel contamination. Specifically, boron modification led to a reduction in hydrogen yield by 30 % for Y-5.1, 56 % for USY-5.2, and 57 % for VUSY- 12 during n-heptane cracking. For TIPB cracking, the corresponding reductions in hydrogen production were 22 %, 56 %, and 45 % for Y- 5.1,  USY-5.2, and  VUSY-12, respectively. Similarly, a  significant decrease in methane production was observed under the same condi-tions. Methane yields were reduced by 31 %, 46 %, and 50 % in Y-5.1, USY-5.2, and VUSY-12, respectively, during n-heptane cracking, while for TIPB cracking, methane reductions were 38 %, 36 %, and 60 % for Y- 5.1, USY-5.2, and VUSY-12, respectively.These results underscore the efficacy of boron in passivating the detrimental effects of nickel by significantly suppressing the formation of hydrogen and light hydrocarbon gases, which are typically associated with  undesirable secondary reactions. The  substantial decrease in hydrogen and methane yields across different zeolite types indicates that boron modification can effectively neutralize nickel-induced dehydro-genation reactions, improving the overall selectivity of the cracking process toward higher-value products.3.6.Proposed mechanisms of nickel deactivation and boron passivation in cracking of hydrocarbons as investigated in this studyThe  detailed reaction mechanisms that  demonstrate the  nickel deactivation and subsequent boron passivation as discussed in this study are outlined as follows:3.6.1.Nickel deactivation mechanismNickel primarily deactivates zeolite catalysts by  facilitating un-wanted dehydrogenation and  carbon formation reactions. During cracking, nickel is  deposited on  the  catalyst from  nickel containing feedstocks in the form of naphthenate. Nickel compounds then oxidise in the regenerator to nickel oxide (NiO) according to Eq. 1: Ni(metal)+12O2→NiO(1) The nickel oxide formed is then reduced to metallic nickel in the reactor riser according to Eq. 2: NiO+H2→Ni(metal)+H2O(2) Here, metallic nickel catalyses dehydrogenation, producing surplus hydrogen and carbon species. The following reaction represents this dehydrogenation and coke formation on nickel sites, which competes with the desired cracking reaction: CnH2n+2→CnH2n+H2(3) CnH2n+2→C(coke)+H2+Hydrocarbons(4) 3.6.2.Boron passivation mechanismTo mitigate nickel-induced deactivation, boron is introduced into the zeolite framework. Boron works by forming stable boron compounds with nickel oxide and altering the zeolite’s acid site distribution, thus reducing nickel’s dehydrogenation activity. The following reaction il-lustrates this interaction: NiO+B2O3→NiB2O4(5) This reaction shifts the reduction temperature of NiO, creating more stable nickel-boron oxide complexes like nickel borate (NiB2O4), which are less reactive in dehydrogenation, thereby suppressing hydrogen and carbon formation.The incorporation of boron introduces additional Bronsted acid sites in the zeolite matrix according to the following equation: SiOAl+B2O3→SiOB+H+(6) These Bronsted acid sites facilitates cracking reactions over dehy-drogenation, favouring the production of desired hydrocarbons such as light alkanes and olefins, over hydrogen and methane. This change en-hances the  cracking efficiency while mitigating undesirable side reactions.4. ConclusionThis study presents a significant advancement in the understanding of boron-modified zeolite catalysts, specifically addressing the challenge of  nickel-induced deactivation in  catalytic cracking processes. The physicochemical and catalytic effects of incorporating boron at con-centrations ranging from 1 to 10 wt% was examined by employing ze-olites of varying silica-to-alumina ratios (Y-5.1, USY-5.2, and VUSY-12) as catalyst substrates. Using n-heptane and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) as model feedstocks, the interplay between boron and nickel in mitigating deactivation effects was systematically evaluated. Key find-ings demonstrate that boron incorporation restored and enhanced the structural and  acidic properties of  the  nickel-deactivated zeolites. Crystallinity recovery reached up  to  93 %,  and  Bronsted acidity improved significantly, as evidenced by pyridine-FTIR. Furthermore, H2-TPR analysis revealed a stabilization of nickel species, with a shift in reduction temperatures, reducing the tendency for undesirable dehy-drogenation reactions. Catalytic performance tests  validated these findings, showing reductions in hydrogen and methane formation by up to  57 %  and 50 %,  respectively, depending on  the  zeolite type  and feedstock. Notably, VUSY-12 exhibited superior performance in cracking heavier hydrocarbons due  to  its  hierarchical mesoporous structure. From a broader perspective, this research offers a pathway to enhance RFCC operations by reducing hydrogen formation, which is detrimental to  process efficiency and  product yields. The  study un-derscores boron’s potential as an environmentally friendly and cost- effective passivator, compared to  traditional approaches involving antimony or lanthanum. By improving catalyst durability and selec-tivity, the findings contribute to more sustainable and economically viable refining processes, with  implications for  reducing waste and lowering operational costs in industries handling nickel-contaminated feedstocks.5. Limitations of the researchThe following limitations were identified during the course of this research. Note that these constraints are not merely supplementary de-tails for future exploration, but rather specific parameters and condi-tions that should recalibrate the interpretation and significance of the findings in this work. i.Most  of  the  sample characterisations and  analyses were  per-formed overseas due  to  non-availability of  equipment in  our current laboratory.ii. The non-condensing gases from Micro-Activity Test (MAT) unit were analysed using a  Gas  Analyzer, rather than Gas Chromatography.iii. Michelle method, rather than  more widely used  Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit was  used for  catalyst deactivation.CRediT authorship contribution statementD.E.
