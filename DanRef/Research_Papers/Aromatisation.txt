Aromatisation of n-pentane: Investigating the effects of microporosity and mesoporosity of bimetallic (Ni-Zn) doped ZSM-5 catalystsS.S. Salisua,b, A. Aliyua,*, A.Y. Attaa, B.J.

Traditional ZSM-5 catalysts face limitations due to their microporous structure, restricting molecular diffusion and mass transfer. To overcome this, ZSM-5 was desili-cated to increase mesoporosity, and Zn and Ni were impregnated to enhance hydride recombination for aromatic production. Desilication of ZSM-5 (Si/Al =47) yielded mesoporous HiZSM-5 (Si/Al =26). Aromatisation of n- pentane showed no aromatics for the non-catalytic process or with microporous ZSM-5. Desilicated mesoporous ZSM-5 achieved an aromatic selectivity of 4.3 %, which increased to 7.8 % with Zn-Ni-doped microporous ZSM- 5. The mesoporous Ni-Zn-doped ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited the highest selectivity at 11.3 %, attributed to improved pore structure and enhanced active sites. This study also outlines the reaction pathways, highlighting the impact of microporosity, mesoporosity and their Ni-Zn doped variants on aromatisation performance. While these findings demonstrate the enhanced aromatisation performance of mesoporous Ni-Zn-doped ZSM-5, certain limitations remain. The influence of reaction conditions such as temperature, flow rate, and feedstock compo-sition on catalytic stability and selectivity requires further investigation. Additionally, the study highlights the need for long-term stability assessments and reactor-scale optimisations to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and industrial applications.1. IntroductionLight aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) are essential as organic chemical raw materials for products such as sur-factants, insecticides and pigment dyes. They serve as key components in the gasoline blending pool due to their high octane number [1]. BTX also play a  crucial role in improving the octane number of gasoline blends [1–3]. Specifically, benzene is widely utilised in downstream chemical processes for manufacturing styrene and phenol. Toluene finds applications in adhesive production, while xylenes are essential for producing purified terephthalic and isophthalic acids [4]. BTX are also converted into various other valuable chemicals, frequently to produce monomers for plastics [5].Various strategies have been employed to modify the microporous ZSM-5 zeolite to enhance both the activity and selectivity of the catalytic cracking process, thereby increasing the production and selectivity to aromatics. Among these tailor-made approaches, the incorporation of metals has been demonstrated to be advantageous in promoting the selectivity to BTX [1,4,6–11].Numerous studies have investigated the factors affecting the per-formance and selectivity of hydrocarbon catalytic cracking. These studies highlight that acidity, pore structure, and stability play crucial roles in determining the variations in catalytic activity and selectivity [12]. Additionally, extensive research has reviewed the impact of metal modification on the catalytic cracking of light alkanes [1,4,9,10,13–23].The aromatisation of light alkanes is  challenging for conventional ZSM-5 catalysts, which are valued for their strong acidity and shape- selective properties, because of the quick deactivation brought on by coke deposition and the limited molecular diffusion [24].Desilication improves the diffusion of alkanes like n-pentane by introducing mesoporosity into the ZSM-5 framework by regulated alkaline treatments, typically using NaOH solutions [25]. Desilicated ZSM-5 decreases coke formation and increases accessibility to active sites, which improves the aromatisation of light alkanes [26].  On the other hand, excessive silicon removal might weaken catalyst stability, therefore careful control is essential [27].

presence of aluminium framework provides protection [28]. Higher ratios can result in excessive and non-selective silicon extraction, affecting the stability and structure of the zeolite. A desirable Si/Al ratio has been found to be between 25 and 50 [29–32,4]. Thus, to preserve the intended equilibrium between mesoporosity and structural integrity, precise control of desilication conditions is necessary [33]. Much study has been done on desilication and metal doping to overcome these constraints [34].Metal doping, especially with gallium [23,14,15,32,35–38], plat-inum [39] and molybdenum [23,40,41], iron [42–45], nickel [46,47] and zinc [16,48–52]  alters ZSM-5′s  electronic properties and acidity, facilitating dehydrogenation, which is necessary for alkane aromatisa-tion. Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts have shown improved BTX selectivity during n-pentane conversion. Over a temperature range of 350 ◦C [53] and 700 ◦C [54–56], co-doping ZSM-5 with bimetals enhance catalytic activity.ZSM-5 bimetallic doping, especially Ni-Zn [19], Fe-Zn [10]  and ZSM-5 desilication [27,57,58] work in conjunction to improve molec-ular mobility and catalytic efficiency in light alkane aromatisation. Although the dual influence of ZSM-5 desilication and Ni-Zn doping on n-pentane aromatisation has yet to be fully understood, desilication [57,59] and bimetallic doping have demonstrated promise in enhancing the aromatisation of light hydrocarbons such as Methane with Pt/Mo, Pt-Sn [54], Mo-Zn [56], Mo-Fe [60] and Mo-Co [55]; Ethane with Pt-Zn [61], Ni-Ga [62], Zn-Ga [63] and Ga-Pt [37]; Propane with Zn-Fe [10], Ni-Zn [19], Zn-Cr, and Mo-Cr [64]; Butane with Pt-Sn and Pt-Ge [65]; Pentane with Ga-P [53], and Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) with Fe-Ga [66].The studies by Pan et al. [67] and Oseke et al. [19] both focus on Zn-Ni catalysts for aliphatic aromatisation, with key contrasts in their preparation methods and catalytic behavior. Pan et al. [67] emphasises the impact of different preparation methods (in-situ hydrothermal syn-thesis vs. co-impregnation) on Zn-Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts for hexane and 1-hexene aromatisation, demonstrating that the intimacy between Zn and Ni species controls aromatic versus isoalkane selectivity during 1-hexene aromatisation. Zn-Ni-ZSM-5 shows a  high isoalkane selec-tivity, whereas Ni/Zn-ZSM-5 yields higher aromatics due to better accessibility of active sites. Oseke et al. [19] uses the co-impregnation method but highlights the synergistic role of nickel in stabilising zinc and enhancing catalytic performance for propane aromatisation. They report significant improvements in propane conversion and aromatic selectivity, especially for the Zn-Ni/ZSM-5 with 2 wt % Zn and 2 wt % Ni. Thus, both works showed the importance of metal interactions in optimising catalytic properties, with Pan et al. [67] focusing more on the structural intimacy of metal species and Oseke et al. [19]  on the metal-loading effects and catalytic performance.Previous works have studied the catalytic cracking of n-pentane using ZMS-5 [29,68]  and the effects of metal modification on the ZSMS-5 in catalytic cracking process using single metal doped ZSM-5 including Zn/ZSM-5 [29,46,68], Ga/ZSM-5 [46], and bimetallic ZSM5 with Ga-P/ZSM-5 [53].  Meanwhile, there is  no work that has investi-gated the effect of microporosity and mesoporosity in bimetallic (Ni-Zn) doped ZSM-5 catalysts on the aromatisation of n-pentane to produce benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). Therefore, in this study, for the first time, we examine the effect of microporous ZSMS-5 and mesoporous ZSM-5 (desilicated) and their nickel-zinc doped variants for the aro-matisation of n-pentane. This study explores the reaction pathways, emphasizing the role of microporosity, mesoporosity, and their Ni-Zn-doped variants in enhancing aromatisation performance.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsA commercial ZSM-5 zeolite with a  silica-to-alumina ratio of 50, supplied by Zeolyst International, was used as the catalyst in this study. Other materials included reagent-grade sodium hydroxide pellets (98 % anhydrous), zinc nitrate (98 % purity), and nickel nitrate, all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. High-purity nitrogen gas (99.9 %) was used as an inert atmosphere. n-Pentane served as the hydrocarbon feed in the catalytic cracking reactions.2.2. Catalysts preparation2.2.1.Alkaline treatment for desilication of microporous ZSM-5The microporous ZSM-5 zeolite with a silica to alumina ratio of 50 acquired in ammonium form (NH4-ZSM-5) was heated to 550 ◦C for 5 h at 30 ◦C /min to convert to hydrogen form of ZSM-5. 16.7 g of the ZSM-5 was dispersed in 500 mL of 0.3 M concentration of sodium hydroxide solution and heated at 65 ◦C for 1 h while stirring [4]. The mixture was cooled using an ice bath, after which the resulting solid was separated by filtration. The solid was repeatedly rinsed with deionised water until the washings reached a neutral pH. It was then dried at 90 ◦C for one hour before undergoing ion exchange with a 1 M ammonium chloride solu-tion at 70 ◦C for three hours. After the exchange process, the material was cooled, filtered, and thoroughly washed. Finally, it was subjected to calcination at 550 ◦C  for five hours to produce protonic hierarchical ZSM-5 (HiZSM-5).2.2.2.Zinc and nickel impregnation on the microporous and mesoporous H- ZSM-5 catalystsThe microporous (ZSM-5) and the desilicated mesoporous (HiZSM-5) catalysts were impregnated with nickel (II) nitrate and zinc nitrate so-lutions. A loading of 2 wt % each of zinc and nickel was utilised for all catalyst preparations [8]. In a typical synthesis, zinc nitrate hexahydrate and nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate containing 2 wt % zinc and 2 wt % nickel, respectively, were dissolved in 100 ml of deionised water and subsequently introduced dropwise into another beaker containing the hierarchical ZSM-5 and dried. The impregnation was maintained at 70 ◦C, and the product dried at 100 ◦C  for 10 h  [4].  The samples were heated to 550 ◦C for 5 h to produce zinc and nickel-impregnated hier-archical H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The original ZSM-5 catalysts were desig-nated as microporous ZSM-5, while the desilicated microporous ZSM-5 was referred to as mesoporous HiZSM-5. The nickel-zinc doped bime-tallic catalysts were then classified as bimetallic microporous Ni-Zn/ZSM-5 and bimetallic mesoporous Ni-Zn/HiZSM-5, respectively.2.2.3.Catalysts characterisationStructural analysis was conducted via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF). The XRD patterns were collected using a Cu Kα radiation source operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. Each sample was scanned from 0 to 70 degrees 2θ at a step size of 0.026261 degrees. HighScore Plus software was used to analyse the XRD patterns and determine crystallite size and phase composition. The Scherrer equation used to estimate crystallite size based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) data is presented in Eq. (1). (1)Where D is the average crystallite size, K is the shape factor (typically assumed to be around 0.9), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, β is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak, and θ is the diffraction angle.The elemental composition of the catalysts was done on Genius IF EX-2600/X-2600 Xenemetrix. 2 g of sample was obtained in the sample cup and then inserted into the sample turret of Genius-IF XRF. The X-ray lamp was warmed, and the voltage and emission current were set to ensure the observed dead time was between 35 and 40 kV. The analysis was performed to obtain the spectrum. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet Is10. The spectra were recorded in transmittance mode with Potassium Bro-mide (KBr) pellets and Nujol (Organic paraffin) at a resolution of 4cm-1 in the range of 450 to 4000cm-1.S.S.

The catalysts ‘surface area and pore size distribution were measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The BET analysis was performed using a Quantachrome NOVA TouchWin v1.22 instrument. At the start, 0.087 g of the catalyst was degassed in a glass cell under vacuum at 300 ◦C for 4 h to remove impurities like water and oils. Af-terward, the sample was maintained at a steady temperature by immersing it in an external liquid nitrogen bath at 195.8 ◦C. Nitrogen gas (the adsorbate) was gradually introduced into the evacuated sample chamber, where it  adsorbed onto the zeolite surface (the adsorbent), creating a thin layer. The specific surface area was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, while pore size distribution was evaluated based on equilibrium gas adsorption data using both the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model and the more precise Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach.Catalyst thermal stability was assessed using simultaneous ther-mogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA), performed on a Perkin Elmer STA 600 instrument. The analysis involved heating the sample from 30 ◦C  to 900 ◦C  at a  rate of 10 ◦C  per minute, then cooling it back to 30 ◦C at 20 ◦C per minute. The procedure was con-ducted under a nitrogen atmosphere maintained at a flow rate of 20 mL/ min. Approximately 3 mg of the sample was weighed into a platinum crucible and placed in the TGA furnace. Prior to initiating the thermal program, the system was allowed to stabilize for 30 min.FESEM analysis was done on Carl Zeiss Supra 55 Germany. 10 mg of the powdered catalyst sample was taken into the sample stub above the carbon tape. To prevent charging effects, the samples were coated with Au-Pt using a spin coater. After coating the sample stub was inserted into the Carl Zeiss Supra 55 Germany instrument for imaging at various magnifications under vacuum. HRTEM was carried out on JEOL JEM- 2100 plus 200Kev. 5 mg of the samples were dispersed in a solvent in a ratio of 1:4 and then subjected to 15 min of sonication. After that, the sonicated samples were cast on a TEM grid made of Cu. Once the sam-ples were dried, the grid was kept inside the TEM instrument JEOL JEM- 2100 plus 200Kev. The images were taken under vacuum conditions on different magnifications.The NH3-TPD analysis was performed on a Micrometrics Auto-Chem II 2920 system fitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 50 mg of each sample were heated to 200 ◦C under 20ml/min flow of Argon (Ar), and held at the temperature for30mins. The samples were then cooled to room temperature under the same Ar atmosphere before being exposed to a  10 % NH3 in helium, flowing at20ml/min for another 30mins. The samples were then purged with argon gas for 30mins to remove any NH3 until the signal returned to baseline. After that, the samples were heated to 850 ◦C  in Ar atmosphere at 10 ◦C  /min and spectra were recorded using TCD. For pyridine (Py)-FTIR analysis of the catalysts, 25 mg of each sample was weighed and then degassed in an oven at 250 ◦C for 2 h. The samples were then transferred to a desiccator containing a petri dish of pyridine, where they were exposed to continuous vacuum for 3  h using a  vacuum pump. Following this preparation, the samples were examined using ATR-FTIR. The powdered zeolite samples were positioned on the ATR crystal and compressed with a swivel to ensure proper contact. The ATR-FTIR spectra were collected over the 650–4000 cm⁻¹  range, with an 8  cm⁻¹  resolution, using 32 sample scans and 16 background scans on a  Cary 630 Agilent FTIR spectrometer.The oxidation states of nickel and zinc were examined through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analysis was performed with an Omicron ESCA+spectrometer (Oxford Instruments, Germany), featuring a monochromatic Mg Kα source and an Argus analyser with inner, mean and outer radii of 120.8, 124, and 127.2 mm, respectively. Prior to analysis, the samples were dispersed in water, briefly sonicated, and stirred. Two drops of the resulting suspension were deposited onto a silicon wafer, air-dried, and then introduced into a high-vacuum chamber. Spectra were collected at a  photoelectron take-off angle of 45◦relative to the surface normal.2.3. Performance testn-Pentane cracking reactions were carried out at atmospheric pres-sure using nitrogen as a diluent in a FINTECH4100 fixed bed continuous flow reactor made of stainless steel with a 9 mm internal diameter. The experimental set-up is presented in Fig. 1.  The reactor bed was composed of 0.5 g of catalyst combined with 1.0 g of silica glass beads. Prior to any experiment, the reactor bed was subjected to vacuum treatment while being continuously purged with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 400 mL per minute and a temperature of 540 ◦C for two hours. In this setup, n-pentane was delivered into the reactor at a flow rate of 4 mL per minute using a  peristaltic positive displacement pump, passing through a  preheater maintained at 80 ◦C, while nitrogen gas was continuously supplied at a rate of 400 mL/min.The condensed liquid products were characterized using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled with a 5977A mass selective detector (MSD), both from Agilent Technologies. Separation was achieved on a DB-624 capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness). The gas chromatograph operated in splitless mode, employing helium as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/ min. A 1 μL  sample volume was introduced via an Agilent G4513A autosampler, with the injector maintained at 250 ◦C. The temperature program for the GC oven started at 40 ◦C (held for 2 min), increased at 10 ◦C/min to 150 ◦C (held for 3 min), and then ramped at 20 ◦C/min to a final temperature of 280 ◦C, held for 5 min, giving a total run time of 28 min per sample. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron ioni-zation mode at 70 eV, with the ion source and quadrupole maintained at 230 ◦C and 150 ◦C, respectively. Data acquisition was performed over an m/z range of 40 to 550, and a 3-min solvent delay was applied to avoid solvent peak interference.Non-condensable gaseous products exiting the reactor were directed to a  Wuhan Cubic Gasboard 3100P gas analyzer for quantification of methane (CH₄), carbon dioxide (CO₂), hydrogen (H₂), and oxygen (O₂). Remaining gaseous components were categorized as C₂–C₄ saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons.3. Results and discussions3.1. Crystallinity and functional groupThe XRD patterns and percentage weight fractions of phases for microporous ZSM-5, mesoporous HiZSM-5, bimetallic microporous Ni- Zn/ZSM-5 and mesoporous Ni-Zn/HiZSM-5 are given Fig. 2(a). Mean-while, the XRD quality analysis results showing percentage weight fractions of phases are presented in the supplementary materials (Fig. S1). The synthesised catalysts exhibited typical ZSM-5 zeolite peaks at 2θ =6◦, 8◦, 9◦, 21◦, 23◦, 24◦and 46◦. This indicates that the ZSM-5 structure was maintained despite the desilication and Ni-Zn deposi-tion. However, closer examination reveals a reduction in peak intensity between 6◦–10◦and 20◦–25◦after desilication. This suggests that there was a fractional dissolution of the ZSM-5 framework and a decrease in crystallinity from 100 of the microporous ZSM-5 to 97.7 for the meso-porous HiZSM-5, 85.6 for the bimetallic microporous Ni-Zn/ZSM-5 and 74.9 for the bimetallic mesoporous Ni-Zn/HiZSM-5. This finding is  in agreement with the work reported by Silagi et al. [69] that exhibited a decrease in crystallinity from 100 before desilication to 86.5 % post desilication. The results in this work also align with previous studies [70–72] that mild desilication of ZSM-5 had no significant effect on the ZSM-5 structure, while another work by Dauda et al. [4]  stated that higher NaOH concentrations over the range of 0.3 M caused an observable decrease. The XRD spectrum did not reveal any discernible peaks indicating the presence of Zn and Ni, which can be attributed to the detection limit of the XRD analyser. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that only 2 wt. % each of Zn and Ni loading were impregnated across the bimetallic catalysts.FTIR Spectra for ZSM-5 catalysts in the lattice vibration region S.S.
