‘Nigeria’, ‘investment barriers’ AND ‘renewable energy’ AND ‘Nigeria’ AND ‘green finance’ AND ‘Nigeria’s energy sector’. A total of 379 ma-terials were initially identified and retrieved based on publication outlet. After screening titles and/or abstracts, 221 materials were excluded for irrelevance to the focus of this review. The remaining 158 materials were subjected to further eligibility screening (full-text), where 85 were excluded based on factors such as publication year (outside 2019–2025), irrelevance of focus, and quality concerns. This process resulted in 72 materials being included in the final review. The materials reviewed are thematically presented in Table 1.  Because of multidimensionality of focus, some of the reviewed materials cut across multiple themes. Journal articles and proceedings published by Elsevier, Springer, Taylor and Francis, Wiley, Sage, Cambridge University Press, IOP, and MDPI (Fig. 2.), basically formed material included in addition to government policies, reports, and historical data. Policy-related ma-terials reviewed include Nigeria’s First Nationally Determined Contri-bution, National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy (NREEEP), National Energy Policy, National Policy on Climate Change and CAT Climate Governance Series. In addition, historical data including Nigeria’s fossil fuel energy supplies, CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, renewable electricity generation, and renewable share of electricity spanned 20-year (2001–2020) were sourced from relevant databases.The narrative approach facilitated a  flexible and descriptive syn-thesis of  relevant literature. The materials selected were subjected to thematic analysis, allowing for the identification and organization of recurring themes across the literature. The analysis focused on catego-rizing insights under five key thematic areas: fossil energy-CO2 dy-namics, RE deployment, technological challenges, financial barriers and pathways to low-carbon ET.Results and discussionNigeria’s fossil energy supplies, fossil-associated CO2 emissions and ETHuman activities, particularly in energy production and use, are primary sources of GHG emissions that contribute to CC (Obada et al., 2024). CO2 emissions are responsible for over 70 % of greenhouse effect (Tunde et al., 2022). While GHGs, such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO2), contribute to global warming, CO2 emissions are the most significant and widely reported. CO2 emissions are directly correlated with energy consumptions (Abeydeera et al., 2019; Chaudhury et  al., 2023; Ghazouani et al., 2020; Yadzi & Dariani, 2019). Fig. 3shows the annual trend of Nigeria’s fossil energy supplies and fossil-associated CO2 emissions (2001–2022). While fossil energy supplies rose from about 772 thousand Tj in 2001 to above 1.7 million Tj in 2022, fossil- associated CO2 emissions increased from about 50 Mt. CO2 in 2001 to Table 1 Materials thematically reviewed.ThemeReferenceFossil-energy-CO2 dynamicsObada et al. (2024), Tunde et al. (2022), Olujobi et al. (2023), Akujor et al.

approximately 100 Mt. CO2 in 2022. The trends of fossil energy supply and related CO2 emissions appear to be broadly similar during the 2001–2022 time-frame. The high and increasing fossil energy supplies highlight the significance of oil, coal and gas as energy sources in different sectors of the Nigerian economy. Excessive dependence on fossil energies in Nigeria’s energy segment has been ascribed to signif-icant rise in CO2 emissions, exceeding levels recorded in industrialized nations with entrenched low-carbon energies policies (Olujobi et  al., 2023). The subdivisions of the transport sector are entirely reliant on fossil fuels, making it the largest consumer of fossil fuels (Akujor et al., 2022; Obada et al., 2024). The country therefore needs policy directives for gradual scaling of low-carbon energy adoption in key sectors, such as transportation, industries, and real estate. For example, transportation companies should be compelled to make a specified percentage of their fleets to use low-carbon energies, such as CNG. The bulk of Nigeria’s electricity production is  thermal and depends on fossil fuels which is highly carbon-emitting and breaches the Paris Agreement that Nigeria is a party to (Salakhetdinov & Agyyeno, 2020) with above 60 % of GHG emissions cuts expected in the energy sector (Roche et al., 2020). Nigeria significantly contributes to Africa’s share of GHGs emission mainly from energy consumption (Afinotan, 2022; Okedere & Oyelami, 2021). The country’s reliance on fossil fuels and energy inefficiency hinders its net- zero emissions goal, requiring a transition to decarbonization (Nwachukwu et al., 2024).In spite of the high and increasing CO2 from fossil energy sources, Nigeria has continued to rely on oil, natural gas, and coal for economic growth and energy supply, making the country’s climate responsiveness challenging. Yet, pursuit of  reliable and affordable energy access re-mains a critical priority for the development of the country. Despite the country’s aspiration for universal energy access by 2030 in  line with SDG 7, while access rate generally stands at 62 %, it is even poorer in the rural areas with 30 % access (Isihak, 2023). Also, negligible improve-ment has been recorded coupled with substantial indications of uneven distribution of electricity across the Nigerian landscape as the southern areas, state headquarters and industrial foci more electrified (Alabi et al., 2023). The poor energy access often triggers reliance on backup generators with high carbon footprints (Amakom et al., 2022).  For instance, above 80 % of small and medium enterprises in Nigeria depend on a fossil-powered generator for operations as a result of failure of grid- connected supply (Roy et  al., 2023).  Therefore, the need to balance energy development to support economic growth and at the same time align with international climate obligations remains a  burning chal-lenge. Amid global ET drive, Nigeria appears to be oil and gas revenue- trapped, with renewed commitment not only in resuscitating its mori-bund refineries, but also issuance of licenses to private investors. Thus, in addition to FG-owned refineries, the country now has the largest privately-owned refinery in Africa as well as modular refineries, with other private-owned ones in the pipeline. Furthermore, illegal artisanal crude oil refining is prevalent, especially in the jungles of the Niger Delta (Bebeteidoh et al., 2020). Emissions from petroleum refining pose sig-nificant environmental threats, including hazards on the surroundings (Odekanle et al., 2021), including carbon from the artisanal crude oil refineries which have been found to breach environmental guidelines and permissible limits (Onakpohor et  al., 2020).  While licensed and standard refineries are not emission-proofed, they are relatively more operationally efficient and monitorable unlike artisanal refineries with no compliance to standard production guidelines coupled with illegal status. Fossil-fuel-based energy sources that emit GHGs are required to give way to cleaner, RE alternatives (Obada et al., 2024).RE deployment in NigeriaPromoting a  green economy is  crucial for mitigating CC risks (Fu et  al., 2024; Han & Gao, 2024).  Thus, deployment of REs is  widely recognized as a significant pathway for transitioning from fossil fuels, providing opportunity for GHGs reduction and energy security (Adedokun et al., 2025). RE sources, such as biomass, hydro, wind, solar and hydrothermal systems, are essentially carbon-neutral, producing negligible GHG emissions (Elum & Momodu, 2017).  Therefore, tran-sitioning to RE to aid CC mitigation is an outstanding strategy that re-quires sustainability to attain energy need of posterity (Owusu & Asumadu-Sarkodie, 2018).  The genre of hydro, wind, biomass and solar have been classified as the most important RE resources in Nigeria (Esan et al., 2019), with a capacity of 1562.5 MW (Bhuiyan et al., 2022).Nigeria is endowed with vast low-carbon energy assets which are yet to be fully harnessed (Obada et  al., 2024; Olujobi et  al., 2023).  For instance, although the country has the potential for generating over 18 GW from hydro assets, only 20 % of it has been harnessed for electrical energy generation (Esan et  al., 2019).  While rivers Niger and Benue, which are the two main rivers traversing the country, have a combined energy potential of 14,750 MW (Chanchangi et al., 2022), exploitation of  small hydro-energy resources which are spread across Nigeria has been identified as a potential for tackling the energy consumption gap (Ugwu et al., 2022). Part of the country’s generated hydroelectricity is supplied to its bordering nations such as Niger based on treaty (Ibrahim et al., 2021) despite lingering domestic energy shortfall.Nigeria has initiated policies toward GHG emission reduction, particularly in the energy sector. CAT (2022)outlined such policy de-velopments as including, “Sectoral Action Plans for Nigeria’s NDC to the UNFCCC of  2017, Revised National CC Policy (2021), Nigeria’s First Nationally Determined Contribution (2021 Update), National Renew-able Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy (NREEEP) (2015), Electricity Vision: 30-30-30, CC Act (2021), Flare Gas (Prevention of  Waste and Pollution) Regulations (S.I. No. 9 of 2018) and Regulations on Feed-In Tariff for R Energy sourced electricity in Nigeria (2015).” Also signifi-cant to the country’s emission reduction drive is Nigeria ET Plan (ETP) of 2023, which aims to achieve a 65 % reduction in emissions, eradicate energy poverty, stimulate investment, and enhance energy efficiency (Nwachukwu et  al., 2024).  Significantly, the CC Act 2021 provides a framework for the attainment of the country’s CC targets, including framework for the realization of  net zero by 2050 whereas NREEEP focusses on RE development while also promoting EE.Despite Nigeria’s climate-related energy policies, studies have identified significant gaps, including vague provisions, poor coordina-tion and misalignment, which hinder effective implementation and harmonization. For instance, while Adedokun et al. (2025)argue that policies supporting RE deployment are hindered by inadequate institu-tional coordination and policy misalignment, Nwankwo et  al. (2024)contend that the country’s energy policy lacks specific provisions for the development and deployment of biogas, hindering its potential to sup-port climate objectives and expand energy access. Furthermore, Okoh and Okpanachi (2023)opine that institutional inaction and harmoni-zation challenges act as obstacles within the energy structure while conflicting policy preferences and political-economic permutations trigger additional predisposition toward the overriding petroleum and gas driven economy. Thus, although Nigeria has set ambitious RE tar-gets, policy implementation has stalled their realization, with missed short-term and mid-term targets (Adedokun et al., 2025). Olujobi et al. (2023)therefore emphasized creating workable policy structure as a critical option for unlocking Nigeria’s renewable and carbon-neutral energy assets.Fig. 4shows the renewable electricity generation and renewable percentage from 2001 to 2022. Renewable electricity generation dipped from 8165 GWh in 2012 to 5315 GWh in 2013 before rising to 9397 GWh in 2022. The renewable percentage of electricity generation in the country declined from 39.50 % in 2001 to 17.44 % in 2015 before following a somewhat increasing and fluctuating pattern till 2022, with 2022 having 24.74 % renewable. Despite Nigeria’s erratic Nigeria’s electricity generation coupled with frequent national grid collapse, the removal of fuel subsidy could trigger adoption of RE sources.The position of Nigeria among some Africa Countries in the Global ET Index Ranking (GETIR) for 2024 is presented in Fig. 5. The country G.O. Atedhor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     EnergyforSustainableDevelopment88(2025)1018104
ranked 108 globally and fell below smaller African economies such as Ghana, Tunisia, Angola, Gabon, Kenya and Morocco. The poor GETIR of Nigeria highlights the fact that its numerous CC commitment in  the energy sector have not fully yielded the desired result. There is the need to translate policies into tangible CC goals through enhanced RE generation.Fig. 6shows Nigeria’s ambitious electricity generation targets from different RE sources by 2030. The targets show that the country is ex-pected to generate 25,143.80 MW of electricity from RE sources by 2030. Unfortunately, while Nigeria’s energy demand is on the increase due to population growth, the huge RE resources across the geopolitical regions remain mostly unharnessed (Ajayi et  al., 2022; Ugwu et  al., 2022). Thus, less than six years to the 2030 SDG deadline, the country’s energy supply from the RE sources remain far below the 2030 targets. Nigeria’s electricity sector has however witnessed some developmental strides in  recent years, including the enactment of  the Electricity Act 2023, commissioning of the 240 MW Afam Three Fast Power and 50 MW Maiduguri Emergency Thermal Power plants as well as the 700 MW Zungeru hydropower plant coupled with new projects underway, such as  1900 MW Egbin Power expansion and the 1300 MW Gwagwalada Independent Power Plant (IEA, 2024).  Overall, the country’s  energy development strategies exhibit conflicting climate realities: low-carbon goals while also prioritizing fossil energy expansion.Techno-financial challenges of low-carbon ETNotwithstanding the substantial environmental and economic ad-vantages of low-carbon energy, particularly RE, significant technolog-ical and financial hurdles persist in Nigeria, impeding large-scale and widespread adoption. This section therefore critically examines the technological and financial barriers constraining low-carbon energy transition in the country.Technological challengesAlthough the low-carbon ET depends heavily on technology, Niger-ia’s technological limitations remain a significant barrier to its realiza-tion.

achieving a  low-carbon ET in  the country: infrastructural limitations, dearth of technological innovation, and inadequate skilled manpower (Table 2).  Although Nigeria is  rich in  energy resources, its outdated electric infrastructure struggles to meet the soaring energy needs of its rapidly growing population, resulting in  a  significant energy supply- demand gap (Oyedepo et al., 2018). Developing countries (Nigeria in-clusive) face the challenge of low grid network and EE (Babayomi et al., 2022). The production and transmission capacity of Nigeria and other African countries are abysmally inadequate coupled with obsolete and ineffective supply network (Adewuyi et al., 2020; Dioha et al., 2025). Prolonged technical ineffectiveness coupled with financial gaps have resulted in poor grid maintenance in Nigeria (Roy et al., 2023). Thus, Nigeria’s power distribution suffers huge energy losses, resulting in only a small proportion of generated power getting to the end users (Adoghe et  al., 2023).  For instance, despite the country’s 13 GW installed ca-pacity, average available power generation capacity hovers around 4.5 GW due to deteriorating power infrastructure, which forces 40 %  of electricity consumption to rely on backup generators (IEA, 2024).Integrating RE into traditional grids poses a  significant challenge, demanding improvements that ensures a reliable, green, and sustainable electricity supply (Adedokun et al., 2025; Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2023). However, despite policy efforts aimed at promoting a sustainable ET, RE technologies have remained not integrated into Nigeria’s energy grid (Adedokun et al., 2025), although decentralized RE solutions, including both off-grid and on-grid technologies, only began to emerge in Nigeria in the 2000s (Edomah et al., 2021). Furthermore, despite their potential to combat CC and alleviate electricity shortages, micro-grid adoption in Nigeria is  hindered by concerns around security and management (Nwangwu et al., 2024). Several incidences of infrastructural damage due to the activities of insurgents and militants have been reported in different parts of Nigeria (Adedokun et al., 2025; Adeyanju et al., 2020; Nwangwu et al., 2024). The country also faces limited digitization and smart technology (Nwaiwu, 2021).  Technology can enable the regis-tration of off-grid power generation by providing digital platforms and mobile applications that streamline data collection, automate licensing processes, and improve real-time monitoring by regulatory authorities. However, uncertainty engulfs the installation capacity statistics of solar power in Nigeria which is complicated by dearth of nationwide regis-tration of  off-grid photovoltaic (PV) installation (Ozoegwu & Akpan, 2021). Furthermore, although blockchain technology has the potential to advance a sustainable energy landscape by enhancing energy-market effectiveness and transparency, facilitating the integration of RE re-sources, and promoting environmental monitoring and economic sus-tainability (Lv, 2023; Popkova et  al., 2023),  Nigeria as well as other countries in Africa are still at the emerging phase of utilization of digital technologies such as smart grids and blockchain in the energy division (Nwaiwu, 2021).  Paucity of  explicit evidence of  application of  block-chain in Nigeria’s energy sector makes the ET to be hazy.Nigeria lacks considerable capacity for producing RE technology gears, resulting in their importation (Abe & Azubuike, 2024; Adebayo et al., 2021; Obada et al., 2024).  For instance, absence of local manufacturing of wind energy component parts has been identified as an obstacle to the penetration of wind energy (Adebayo et al., 2021). The country suffers shortage of critical climate change mitigation technologies (Nwachukwu et al., 2024). Notably, while the country re-lies heavily on fossil fuel-powered transport technology (Akujor et al., 2022; Obada et  al., 2024),  Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) strategy which combines carbon capture and carbon storage (CSS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies, is  lacking, with development hindered, among others, inadequate policies, and limited public awareness (Nwali et al., 2024).Although Nigeria’s energy policy seeks to uphold administrative proficiency and local participation (Energy Commission of Nigeria, 2018), the country is still plagued by dearth of relevant manpower for the exploitation of climate-friendly energy options. Nigeria RE demands is hindered by a shortage of trained local technicians, emphasizing the need for enhanced technical skill transfer and training programmes, especially in rural areas (Obada et al., 2024). The requirement of annual maintenance visits by German experts for Nigeria’s German-engineered machines highlights the need to  move beyond technology transfer to technology absorption, guaranteeing that green technologies are adapted to  local contexts and can be effectively deployed and main-tained by local communities (Abe & Azubuike, 2024).  Research and development (R&D) are cardinal to promoting development and improvement of existing energy technologies toward meeting the countries climate goals. Unfortunately, the country is plagued by dearth of research and development (R&D) on RE (Adepoju et al., 2022) coupled with mass exodus of skilled labour in search for greener pastures due to worsening hardship.Financial barriersThis section examines contexts of financial barriers to low-carbon ET in Nigeria, as outlined in Table 3. Funding deficiency has been identified as a major obstacle in tackling the world’s most critical environmental issues (Brand et al., 2021), particularly in Africa. With tripled external debts since 2008, making the largest debt increase and debt-to-revenue ration in the developing world, sub-Saharan Africa requires innovative financing solutions to  access affordable capital and achieve its devel-opment and climate objectives (Gallagher et al., 2024).

reference to Nigeria indicates that while RE development requires sig-nificant investment, the country needs $177 billion to achieve its Na-tionally Determined Contributions (NDC) by 2030 (FGN, 2021b),  the country’s total public debt as at 31st December 2024 stood at 94.2251 billion US dollars (Debt Management Office Nigeria, 2025). Increasing debt servicing burden coupled with budget deficits, have continued to threaten the realization of the country’s climate goals, including its NDC through energy ET. Yet, the country’s electricity sector has continued to suffer revenue deficits coupled with corruption, triggering wide regime financial rescues (Roy et al., 2023).There are diverse instances of how investment limitation obstructs Nigeria’s low-carbon ET. While green investment facilitates a seamless transition to a low-carbon economy (Gao et al., 2023), Africa’s renew-able drives are adversely affected by prevailing financial operations (Sweerts et al., 2019). Policy plays a critical role in influencing the scale of investment in RE technology (Abbass et al., 2022). Although policy suggestions such as tariff incentives, capital awards and Feed-in Tariffs (FiT) to boost solar power infiltration in Nigeria have been proposed, implementation is still partial (Adebayo et al., 2021). Nigeria’s RE in-vestment is  hindered by vague policy and frail funding mechanisms (Isah et al., 2023). While Brazil’s transition to RE is propelled by radical funding through its Development Bank, international organizations and multilateral development financial institutions constitute the chief funder of RE in Nigeria (Isah et al., 2023).  Although Nigeria’s  is endowed with huge RE resources, representing viable market for participation of  the private sector in  its electricity sector, lack of  in-vestment guarantee remains a challenge (Adeyanju et al., 2020), foreign sources of funding could be unreliable due to unpredictability of global diplomatic relations.A major challenge that hinders adoption of low-carbon energy is the high cost of associated technologies, particularly high initial cost (Obada et al., 2024; Ogbonna et al., 2023), including the cost of photovoltaic panels and batteries, wind turbines, and installations. Notably, while electric vehicles offer the greatest cost savings, reducing costs by up to 75 % per kilometer, and minimizing energy loss to 33 %, they are also associated with battery-related cost challenges (Farghali et al., 2023). Unfortunately, although Dimnwobi et al. (2022)have demonstrated that Nigeria’s  transition to  RE is  aided by the growth of  the financial in-dustry, Obada et al. (2024)have noted that financial institutions often view RE investments as high-risk, preferring to fund established fossil fuel projects, and consequently charge higher interest rates and offer shorter loan terms for RE initiatives. RE investors are confronted by price elasticity and production uncertainty risks, particularly for tech-nologies extremely reliant on weather circumstances, like wind and solar (Alcorta et al., 2024) while utilization is considerably affected by financial risk (Li et al., 2025). Yet, the devalued state of the Nigerian currency makes importation of RE technological components highly expensive and unaffordable to majority of the people who live in poverty.Underinvestment in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in emerging markets hinders the advancement of RE transition, ultimately slowing progress (Chipangamate & Nwaila, 2024). There is low awareness of carbon offset initiatives (Mohammad et  al., 2023) amid largely untapped funding opportunities (Mutarindwa et al., 2024). Despite the benefits of  Environmental Impact Bonds (EIBs), they are largely unknown outside of conservation finance circles and project stakeholders, limiting their broader adoption and potential impact (Brand et al., 2021). While a survey of road users in northeastern Nigeria shows their willingness to pay for carbon offset at a low price, education and awareness are still necessary to promote environmental sustain-ability through carbon offset initiatives (Mohammad et al., 2023).Despite the potential of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) bonds to fund African governments’ and corporations’ CC miti-gation efforts, the continent receives less than 0.3 % of global ESG bond issuance volume (Mutarindwa et al., 2024), which mirrors the prevail-ing under-utilization of low-carbon energy funding resources in Nigeria. Green finance (GF) has been shown to  play a  vital role in  mitigating environmental degradation while simultaneously promoting sustainable economic growth of members of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (Chin et al., 2024).  While studies have established that GF facilitates RE advancement (Khan et  al., 2024; Subramaniam & Loganathan, 2023; Tufail et  al., 2024),  green energy projects face significant challenges, including limited financing, low returns, high risks, and inadequate market capacity (Taghizadeh-Hesary & Yoshino, 2020). Key GF metrics which have a positive impact on investments in RE include depth, sta-bility, and efficiency (Xia et al., 2023). Despite these array of funding opportunities, like many other developing economies, Nigeria is trapped in a cycle of underinvestment (Abdulkarim, 2023).Technological low-carbon energy pathwaysGrid modernization and decentralizationDeveloping infrastructure can substantially enhance energy access, reliability, and efficiency, especially in remote and disadvantage areas (Abe & Azubuike, 2024).  Nigeria needs to carry out extensive grid maintenance and replacement of unserviceable components to reduce power loss during transmission. Moreover, transitioning to sustainable energy systems requires advanced technologies, including smart grid (Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2023) and integration of renewables. Addition-ally, developing micro-grids and mini-grids is necessary to serve rural and off-grid areas with RE. Off-grid strategies, comprising mini-grid and detached solutions could be relevant in unpowered rural areas (Gungah et al., 2019; Oyedepo et al., 2018).  To this end, it  is  important to encourage distributed generation through rooftop solar, wind, and biomass systems.Promotion of EE developmentAccomplishing the 1.5 ◦C  temperature goal requires enormous amounts of EE and climate-friendly technologies (Okoh & Okpanachi, 2023). Applying RE, EE technologies, smart design strategies can reduce energy consumption by up to 40 % (Farghali et al., 2023).

is  making strides, with the current initiative to convert vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) which could reduce vehicular CO2 emissions, there is  the need to increase conversion centres across the country. Furthermore. Achieving net-zero emissions in key sectors like cement production demand significant investments in EE (Roche, 2023), while deploying deep neutral network (DNN) in buildings can signifi-cantly reduce energy consumption (Farghali et al., 2023). To promote EE initiatives in Nigeria, sustainable energy development requires management systems, storage solutions (Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2023), and carbon offset programmes (Okoh & Okpanachi, 2023), which can capture CO2 from power plants and industrial processes, and storing it underground (Nwali et al., 2024).  To curb energy wastage, Nigeria needs to promote the use of EE appliances through providing tax holi-days to  local manufacturers and import duty waiver for importers of high energy efficient appliances. To this end, the country needs policy to make it compulsory for firms to submit energy audit report yearly, with appropriate sanction imposed on violators of energy-efficient practice.Complementary deployment of REsTo overcome the limitations of intermittency associated with hydro, solar, and wind energy, RE sources should be deployed to complement each other, thereby bridging shortages caused by natural factors. For instance, hydropower can be effectively utilized in  several regions to offset the seasonal fluctuations of  irregular RE sources, such as solar (Gonzalez et al., 2022). As the country transition to net-zero emissions, natural gas is  expected to  play a  bridging role in  the short-term and medium-term, while solar may dominate the long-term technology mix (Shari et  al., 2024).  Furthermore, the Nigeria’s vast and natural eco-systems offer a  convenient and cost-effective pathway to  mitigate CC through nature-based solutions (Ogbonna et al., 2023), such as ethanol from cassava, sugar cane, and jatropha feedstock and palm oil-based biodiesel. Since, waste management in Nigeria is currently inadequate, resulting in environmental pollution (Okere et al., 2019), the country’s ecological diversity, enormous population size, and municipal and in-dustrial wastes offer significant bio-fuel prospects (Nwozor et al., 2021), with a technical power prospect of approximately 2.33 EJ that could be generated from existing biomass resources (Jekayinfa et al., 2020).Promotion of local manufacturing and technological absorptionTo forester a smooth low-carbon ET, the Nigerian government should facilitate technology transfer partnerships between local firms and global clean-tech companies. To enable absorption of transferred tech-nology, favourable local environment should be created to encourage adoption. This should include supporting domestic manufacturing of RE technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and battery technol-ogies through tax breaks and subsidies.Advancing research, innovation, developmentBecause the low-carbon ET has both short-term and long-term goals, it is important that the country stays on track in deepening low-carbon energy research and promoting innovative approaches across all facets of the transition, supported by built-in monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Knowledge dissemination is  essential for a  secure and equitable ET, which can help alleviate energy poverty and social dis-parities (Buonomano et  al., 2023).  Therefore, achieving robust low- carbon energy research should include promotion of strategic university-industry partnerships. While innovative technologies are critical to realizing energy efficiency and mitigate the impact of CC (Farghali et al., 2023), such innovative low-carbon technologies should encompass power generation and distribution, EE, and carbon capture and storage. For example, bioremediation and phytoremediation have been identified as effective low-carbon solutions for cleaning up the Niger Delta region, offering a cost-effective and adaptable approach to local environmental conditions (Azuazu et al., 2023).Capacity building and developmentTo address shortfall in RE engineers and technicians, Nigeria needs to launch and encourage more technical training programmes. For instance, intensification of certification programmes for energy pro-fessionals could be vital to guarantee quality and safety in renewable installations. Moreover, existing university-based energy centres across Nigeria’s geopolitical regions should be made to live up to their man-dates by spearheading low-carbon energy innovation and deployment, thereby evolving into dynamic hatcheries of clean energy solutions.Financial pathways to low-carbon energyAdopting innovative and sustainable financing modelsAdopting innovative and sustainable low-carbon energy financing strategies is  critical to Nigeria’s climate responsiveness. This could facilitate economic growth while balancing environmental safety and economic resilience (Hossin et  al., 2024).  Viable approaches include incentivizing private sector investment in RE (Obada et al., 2024), col-lective financing models where communities pool resources (Nduka, 2022), and blended finance, combining public and private funding (Isah et al., 2023).  Thus, to enhance green investment, solutions include leveraging public institutions, pension funds, and insurance companies, while also implementing tax incentives, green credit guarantees, com-munity trust funds, and risk-reduction strategies (Taghizadeh-Hesary & Yoshino, 2020).  Community RE initiatives encompass community- owned, cooperative, public private partnerships (PPPs), and third- party ownership models (Kaze et al., 2025).  PPPs are appropriate because of  their capacity for risk management and cost effectiveness benefits, offering a flexible approach, enabling balanced risk and return distribution between public and private sectors (Tahir et al., 2024). They have been found to successful drive RE in countries like China and India (Raghutla & Kolati, 2023). Similarly, Egyptian RE projects are typically implemented as PPPs to leverage private sector financing and mitigate the government’s burden of high upfront costs (Othman & Kallaf, 2023). This aligns with Nigeria’s CC Act which broadens emission re-sponsibilities to both government institutions and private sector part-nerships (PPPs) to unlock financing and expand market opportunities for RE project developers (Nduka, 2022). Also, multinationals, especially in the oil sector, should channel their corporate responsibilities to host communities by establishing multipurpose RE projects instead of pre-vailing limited-purpose RE projects.Green bonds, an eco-friendly investment instrument, have gained popularity since the Paris Agreement, offering traditional bond char-acteristics while funding environment projects (Gao et al., 2023). Since companies that issue green bonds tend to  have better environmental performance, lower carbon emissions (García et  al., 2023),  it  can be implemented as cost-effective options to enhance RE growth and miti-gate CC (Akrofi et al., 2022; Rosoulinezhad & Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2022).  Additionally, EIBs can be explored as mechanisms for gener-ating capital required for environmental projects, repaying investors with interest from financial benefits generated by the project’s envi-ronmental outcomes (Brand et al., 2021; Trotta, 2024).Promoting cost reduction strategiesTo reduce the adverse impacts of high exchange rate and high import duties on RE components, it is imperative to stabilize the value of the Naira and remove import duties on clean energy equipment to  make renewable technology more affordable and adoptable. Rather than adopt outright ban of importation of solar panels, as it  is being contemplated by the government, in the interim, local manufacturers should be protected from unfavourable competition from their foreign counterparts through incentives like tax holidays or tolerable tax, since their present production capacity cannot meet the high local demands due to the country’s high and growing population size. Providing low- interest rates and tax incentives to solar low-carbon investors, among others, is important for achieving a low-carbon future in Nigeria (Shari G.O. Atedhor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     EnergyforSustainableDevelopment88(2025)1018108
et al., 2023).  These measures coupled with appropriate regulatory frameworks can promote transparency, accountability, and fair competition, fast-tracking the country’s  ET (Abe & Azubuike, 2024). While cost can also be reduced through promotion of bulk procurement initiatives, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should intensify provision of RE grants and initiate fiscal policies that prioritizes disbursement of low-interest rates loans for RE technologies. It is also important to pri-oritize RE projects in budgetary allocation (Adebayo et al., 2021) and formulation of  policies that promote the introduction of  financial in-centives, such as awarding RE firms tax discounts to induce non-public investors into the segment (Adeyanju et al., 2020).De-risking RE investmentsTo reduce volatility, Nigeria needs to create sovereign green energy fund to provide guarantees for projects and implement credit enhance-ment programmes to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the RE sector. Since investors may only risk their capital in RE ventures if they are sure of making a profit (Christophers, 2022), it is also important to  create energy insurance schemes to  tackle the financial risks con-nected with project fiascos. Since funding terms and eliminating in-vestment risk can contribute significantly to realizing carbon neutrality (Matth ̈aus & Mehling, 2020),  the country needs to develop funding terms that are low-carbon energy-investment-friendly. Again, this should include CBN using its fiscal control instruments to direct pref-erential lending rates for RE investors and expand financial inclusion initiatives (Dimnwobi et al., 2022). Promoting the participation of non- banking organizations, such as insurance firms, can also tackle financial constraints in  long-term clean energy ventures (Taghizadeh-Hesary & Yoshino, 2020).  Also, because easing financial limitations aids both climate justice due to increase in RE and inexpensive energy in emerging economies (Calcaterra et al., 2024), adoption of PPPs could also offer flexible financing approach, enabling a  balanced distribution of  risks and returns between public and sector via a mix of financial instruments (Tahir et al., 2024). Lastly, it is imperative to carefully study global trade relation, particularly unfolding US-tariff hikes and adopt informed policy response, particularly taking into cognizance importation of RE components.Carbon pricing and subsidy reformsThe financing challenge in the country’s low-carbon ET can also be assuaged by intensifying implementation of carbon tax and introduction of emission trading system while sustaining fossil fuel subsidy phase out to generate and redirect funds to clean energy projects and provision of incentives. Carbon tax encourages consumers to  reduce carbon emis-sions by switching to environment-friendly alternatives, and promoting healthier choices (Nemavhidi & Jegede, 2023). It is therefore considered as a  key measure to reduce GHG emissions and support the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature increase to below 2 ◦C (Fujimori et al., 2020; Yang, 2024). It has consequently been argued that implementing carbon taxes can deter pollution, generate revenue for environmental mitigation, and attract foreign direct investment, making it  vital for African countries to  expedite its adoption (Yiadom et  al., 2024). Fortunately, evidence shows that investing carbon tax revenue for climate-related projects increases public acceptance, perceived fairness, and effectiveness of the tax (Maestre-Andres et al., 2021). Be-sides, lower-income households would face relatively lesser financial burdens from carbon pricing and would benefit more from cash transfers through improved infrastructure (Dorband et al., 2022).Canvassing for debt forgivenessSub-Saharan Africa requires debt relief, among others, to mobilize finance and support the Paris Agreement and SDGs (Gallagher et  al., 2024).  This could reduce Nigeria’s  financial burden, enabling the country to embark on capital-intensive low-carbon energy projects, such as building more hydro-electric power plants, particularly in the humid southern region, and establishing solar farms, especially in the semi-arid northern part of the country.Leveraging international climate financeForeign direct investment and regional financial organizations’ support are critical for scaling up RE investment (Abbass et al., 2022; Ibrahiem & Hanafy, 2021; Mutezo & Mulepo, 2021). Therefore, Nigeria needs to make optimal use of the array of multilateral funds from in-ternational institutions, such as global environment fund (GEF), green climate fund (GCF), least develop countries fund (LDCF), and special CC fund (SCCF). The country should explore low-carbon projects funding opportunities in  World Bank and African Development Bank (AfDB). Additionally, the country in collaboration with other countries with similar emission profile need to send delegation of experts to the Con-ferences of the Parties (COP) to canvass better and realistic compensa-tion by high polluting countries, such as China and the United States of America.Strengthening financial policy and regulatory frameworksNigeria’s  energy strategies have continued to send mixed signal, promoting RE while also prioritizing fossil fuels. The country’s  low- carbon ET is  hindered by insufficient policies and centralized energy strategies, highlighting the necessity for a more inclusive, participator, and decentralized approach (Kaze et al., 2025). Since these challenges can hinder techno-financial advancement toward low-carbon ET, the country needs frameworks harmonization, promoting specificity, devolution of legislative responsibility and inclusivity, to be more climate-driven. Government needs to develop a  framework that pro-motes adoption of FiTs to ensure fixed payments to RE producers for the amount of electricity they generate and feed into the national grid over a stipulated time. This guaranteed investment return could make the RE sector attractive, stimulate grid expansion, and further decentralize the energy sector. Already the decentralization of the Nigerian electricity sector into the GenCos, TranCos and DisCos, with assigned regulatory authorities has led to  growth of  its transmission infrastructure up to 10,000 km (Babatunde et al., 2023).ConclusionThis paper reviewed Nigeria’s climate responsiveness in the energy sector, focusing on energy-climate complexities, techno-financial chal-lenges, and pathways to low-carbon ET. Selected materials, comprising journal articles, conference proceedings, government policies, federal government technical reports, technical report, and data sourced from databases were reviewed adopting narrative review approach, under five key thematic areas: fossil energy-CO2 dynamics, RE deployment, technological challenges, and financial barriers as well as pathways to low-carbon ET. Findings reveal that Nigeria’s climate responsiveness in the energy sector is marked by contradictory trajectories–promoting a low-carbon ET while simultaneously expanding fossil fuel development amid rising trend in CO2 emissions. Despite setting ambitious RE targets, the country’s  ET continues to be constrained by technological and financial challenges. The technological challenges to low-carbon ET include old grid infrastructures, poor grid maintenance, inadequate generation and transmitting capacity, poor micro-grid adoption, shortage of  critical CC mitigation technologies, reliance on imported technologies, poor integration of RE into national grid, poor R&D, and inadequate skilled manpower. Financial threats to low-carbon ET include mounting debt burden, poor fiscal policy implementation, fossil energy-skewed investment, lack of investment guarantee, perceived high-risk of RE investment, weak domestic-driven funding mechanisms, corruption, poor harnessing of funding opportunities, high initial cost of low-carbon technologies, and high cost of imported RE technology components. To effectively tackle the technological threats to the country’s low-carbon ET, proposed pathways include grid moderniza-tion and decentralization, advancing research, innovation and devel-opment, promotion of energy efficient development, facilitation of local G.O.

manufacturing and technological transfer, and capacity building and development, while financial strategies for low-carbon ET include adoption of  innovative financing models, such as  PPPs, cooperatives, and third-party ownerships, promotion of cost reduction strategies, de- risking RE investments, adoption of carbon pricing and subsidy re-forms, canvassing for debt forgiveness, and leveraging international climate financing. Other viable options include policy measures aimed at further decentralizing electricity sector to stimulate expansion of the RE sector and safeguarding energy infrastructures, adoption of FiTs, and gradual scaling of low-carbon energy deployment in key sectors, such as transportation, industries, and real estate. To promote capital flow to the RE sector, the CBN should consider stimulating flow of low interest loans into the sector using its fiscal control instruments while government should consider increase in budgetary allocation to RE projects. Overall, the study offers valuable insights into Nigeria’s climate-responsiveness in the energy sector, highlighting energy-climate dynamics, the status of RE development, and key technological and financial challenges, while proposing viable pathways for advancing the low-carbon ET and enhancing energy access. Notwithstanding the breadth and insights of this review, reliance on a narrative rather than systematic approach may have introduced limitations, especially the risk of bias. While the review provides insights into Nigeria’s climate responsiveness within the con-texts of  energy-climate complexities, techno-financial challenges, and pathways to low-carbon ET, further studies could explore perspectives such as quality control compliance of imported low-carbon energy technologies, justice and equity considerations and the role of sub- national governments in implementing climate-responsive energy policies.CRediT authorship contribution statementGodwin Oghenebrozie Atedhor: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Resources, Methodology, Conceptualization.Declaration of competing interestThe author declares no conflict of interest.ReferencesAbbass, K., Qasim, M.
