# Recommendation on Engaging a Local Journalist ("Footsoldier") in Nigeria

**Query:** Should we engage a local journalist based in Nigeria to assist with the Dangote Refinery pitch project?

**Background:** The project involves researching and writing on the refinery's governance and environmental impacts, requiring access to communities in Lekki, experts, and potentially sensitive data. Ola’ Arowolo is Nigerian but may benefit from on-the-ground support for interviews, fact-checking, and cultural navigation.

## Pros of Engagement
- **Local Expertise and Access:** A Nigerian-based journalist would have insider knowledge of local dynamics, language (e.g., Pidgin English), and networks, enabling easier access to affected communities (e.g., Ilekuru, Idasho) and officials, reducing delays in stakeholder interviews.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Addresses security risks (e.g., physical safety in Lekki) by leveraging local knowledge for safe fieldwork. Also mitigates operational risks like data gaps or miscommunications.
- **Credibility and Depth:** Enhances article authenticity with firsthand reporting, aligning with journalistic standards for C&EN. Could uncover nuanced stories (e.g., evictions, health impacts) that remote research misses.
- **Cost-Effective for Quality:** If budgeted properly, a freelancer could provide high-value insights without full-time commitment, potentially justifying the expense against potential rejections or weak pitches.

## Cons of Engagement
- **Financial Impact:** Adds costs (e.g., $500-2000 for a short-term gig, depending on experience), eating into Ola’s potential $2000 earnings or requiring upfront investment. Could strain the project's low-budget nature.
- **Coordination Challenges:** Time zones, communication barriers, and integration with Andy/Ola’s workflow could introduce delays or inconsistencies, exacerbating collaboration risks.
- **Potential Biases or Risks:** Local journalists might have affiliations (e.g., with Dangote or government), risking biased reporting or security issues (e.g., harassment). Confidentiality breaches could occur if not vetted properly.
- **Unnecessary if Virtual Suffices:** With existing sources (Guardian, PDFs), virtual interviews might suffice, avoiding added complexity.

## Recommendation
- **Yes, Engage If Feasible:** Strongly recommend if the budget allows and the journalist adds unique value (e.g., exclusive interviews). This could elevate the pitch's quality, reducing rejection risks and enhancing Ola’s section. Target a reputable freelancer via platforms like Upwork, local networks (e.g., Nigerian Guild of Editors), or Ola’s contacts.
- **Selection Criteria:** Choose someone with experience in environmental/energy journalism, no conflicts of interest, and references. Start with a trial assignment (e.g., 1-2 interviews) to assess fit.
- **Budget and Scope:** Allocate $1000-1500; define deliverables (e.g., 3-5 interview transcripts, site notes). Include NDA for security.
- **Alternatives:** If not, rely on Ola’s networks and virtual tools; monitor if this increases risks in the assessment.

**Next Steps:** Confirm budget availability and Ola’s preference. If proceeding, draft a contract outline.
