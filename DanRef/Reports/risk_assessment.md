# Risk Assessment for Dangote Refinery Pitch Project

**Project Overview:** This project involves collaborating on a pitch for two C&EN articles on the Dangote Refinery, focusing on Nigeria's chemical industry. Andy Extance covers chemistry/economics; Ola’ Arowolo handles governance/environment. Total word count: 2000 (Ola: 1000 words, earning $2000 at $2/word). The project includes research synthesis, outline drafting, and potential article writing, drawing from PDFs, news stories, and stakeholder inputs.

**Assessment Methodology:** Risks are identified based on project scope, stakeholder involvement, and external factors. Each risk is rated for Likelihood (Low/Medium/High) and Impact (Low/Medium/High), with mitigation strategies. Overall risk level is calculated as Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H).

## 1. Operational Risks

- **Risk: Delays in Research or Interviews**  
  _Description:_ Accessing stakeholders (e.g., community members, experts) or synthesizing research from PDFs/news may take longer than expected due to time zones, availability, or data gaps.  
  _Likelihood:_ Medium (interviews can be unpredictable).  
  _Impact:_ Medium (could delay deadlines, affecting C&EN submission).  
  _Mitigation:_ Schedule buffer time; use existing sources (e.g., Guardian article) as backups; conduct virtual interviews early.  
  _Overall Level:_ Medium.

- **Risk: Collaboration Breakdown**  
  _Description:_ Miscommunication between Andy and Ola could lead to inconsistent narratives or missed deadlines.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low (prior collaboration history).  
  _Impact:_ High (could jeopardize the pitch).  
  _Mitigation:_ Regular check-ins via email/phone; shared Google Docs for outlines; clear division of labor.  
  _Overall Level:_ Medium.

- **Risk: Scope Creep**  
  _Description:_ Expanding research or adding sections beyond 2000 words could inflate workload.  
  _Likelihood:_ Medium (temptation to include more data).  
  _Impact:_ Low (manageable with word limits).  
  _Mitigation:_ Stick to outlines; use word count trackers.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

## 2. Financial Risks

- **Risk: Non-Payment or Underpayment**  
  _Description:_ C&EN may reject the pitch or pay less than $2/word, affecting Ola’s $2000 earnings.  
  _Likelihood:_ Medium (rejection is possible).  
  _Impact:_ High (financial loss for Ola).  
  _Mitigation:_ Negotiate upfront; diversify income sources; track payment terms in contracts.  
  _Overall Level:_ Medium.

- **Risk: Unexpected Costs**  
  _Description:_ Travel, tools (e.g., Pandoc for formatting), or research subscriptions could arise.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Low.  
  _Mitigation:_ Budget for essentials; use free tools where possible.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

## 3. Legal and Compliance Risks

- **Risk: Defamation or Misrepresentation**  
  _Description:_ Inaccurate portrayal of Dangote, communities, or environmental issues could lead to lawsuits.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low (fact-based research).  
  _Impact:_ High (legal fees, reputational damage).  
  _Mitigation:_ Fact-check all claims; cite sources; consult legal expert if needed.  
  _Overall Level:_ Medium.

- **Risk: Data Privacy Issues**  
  _Description:_ Handling sensitive community data (e.g., eviction stories) without consent.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Medium.  
  _Mitigation:_ Obtain permissions; anonymize sources.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

- **Risk: Intellectual Property Infringement**  
  _Description:_ Unintentional plagiarism from PDFs or news.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Medium.  
  _Mitigation:_ Use plagiarism checkers; paraphrase properly.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

## 4. Reputational Risks

- **Risk: Negative Backlash from Stakeholders**  
  _Description:_ Dangote or Nigerian officials may view the article as critical, damaging relationships.  
  _Likelihood:_ Medium (environmental focus is sensitive).  
  _Impact:_ Medium (future opportunities).  
  _Mitigation:_ Balance criticism with positives; frame as constructive journalism.  
  _Overall Level:_ Medium.

- **Risk: Public Perception of Bias**  
  _Description:_ Article seen as anti-industry or pro-environmentalist.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Low.  
  _Mitigation:_ Maintain neutrality; disclose affiliations.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

## 5. Technical Risks

- **Risk: Tool or Software Failures**  
  _Description:_ Issues with Pandoc, file sharing, or research databases.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Low.  
  _Mitigation:_ Backup files; test tools beforehand.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

- **Risk: Data Loss**  
  _Description:_ Losing research files or outlines.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Medium.  
  _Mitigation:_ Cloud backups (e.g., Google Drive); version control.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

## 6. Security Risks

- **Risk: Cyber Threats (e.g., Hacking or Phishing)**  
  _Description:_ Shared documents (e.g., Google Docs) or emails could be compromised, leading to data breaches or intellectual property theft.  
  _Likelihood:_ Medium (common in collaborative projects).  
  _Impact:_ High (loss of unpublished work, reputational damage).  
  _Mitigation:_ Use secure platforms (e.g., encrypted Google Drive); enable two-factor authentication; avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive work.  
  _Overall Level:_ Medium.

- **Risk: Data Breaches or Leaks**  
  _Description:_ Sensitive stakeholder data (e.g., community stories) or research could be leaked accidentally or maliciously.  
  _Likelihood:_ Low.  
  _Impact:_ Medium.  
  _Mitigation:_ Encrypt files; limit access to collaborators; use NDAs if sharing with third parties.  
  _Overall Level:_ Low.

- **Risk: Physical Security During Fieldwork**  
  _Description:_ If conducting in-person interviews in Nigeria, safety issues (e.g., in Lekki or Niger Delta areas) could arise.

## Overall Project Risk Level

- **Summary:** Most risks are Medium or Low, with operational, financial, and security aspects being the primary concerns. The project is feasible with mitigations, but monitoring collaboration, deadlines, and data security is key.
- **Contingency Plan:** If major delays occur, pivot to a single article or extend timeline. Regularly review risks in check-ins.
- **Recommendations:** Conduct a mid-project review; involve a third-party editor for quality assurance; implement basic cybersecurity hygiene.
