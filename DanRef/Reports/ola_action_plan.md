# Action Plan for Ola’ Arowolo: Exploring Governance and Environmental Issues in the Dangote Refinery Pitch

## Objective

As per the pitch assignment, Ola’ Arowolo will focus on the cultural, governance, and social challenges of the Dangote refinery, including environmental impacts, evictions, gas flaring, and alignment with Nigeria's climate goals. The goal is to produce a balanced, investigative section for the C&EN article, drawing from research papers, news stories, and stakeholder insights to highlight issues and propose solutions. This complements Andy Extance's chemistry/economics focus.

## Key Themes to Cover

Based on the pitch, research questions, and analyzed stories:

- **Governance and Policy:** Regulatory gaps, international financing, lessons from past refineries, corruption avoidance.
- **Environmental Impact:** Gas flaring, flooding risks, biodiversity loss, health effects (e.g., cancer risks near refineries).
- **Social and Cultural Issues:** Forced evictions, livelihood loss (fishing, farming), community compensation, cultural heritage, public acceptance of industrial projects.
- **Climate Alignment:** Contradictions between fossil expansion and low-carbon pledges; potential for transitions (e.g., CNG/EVs).
- **Relevance to Stories:** Integrate insights from Guardian article (evictions, health), NADDC/Bolt/Kogi CNG/EV initiatives (clean transport), and CEN (chemistry perspectives).

## Action Plan Steps

### 1. Research Preparation and Initial Interviews (Week 1)

- **Review Materials:** Quickly scan pitch, key research papers (focus on "Nigeria’s climate responsiveness," "Future prospects," Guardian article), and stories report. Identify top citations and data points.
- **Develop Interview List and Start Outreach:** Target 5-8 key stakeholders (prioritize accessible ones like community leaders in Lekki, Lagos EPA officials, Prof. Orish Ebere Orisakwe). Send emails/intros via local contacts.
- **Data Collection:** Pull public environmental reports, emission data, and compensation records online (e.g., IFC, Lagos government sites). Conduct 2-3 initial virtual interviews.

### 2. Field Research and Core Interviews (Week 2)

- **Site Visits and Interviews:** Visit Lekki refinery area and evicted communities (focus on Lagos; virtual for others). Conduct 5-8 in-person/virtual interviews using research questions (e.g., evictions, gas flaring).
- **Surveys and Documentation:** Quick surveys (10-20 responses) on livelihoods/health; document with photos/notes.
- **Prioritize:** Focus on high-impact sources (e.g., Guardian communities, experts).

### 3. Data Analysis and Synthesis (Week 3)

- **Analyze Data:** Map interviews/surveys to themes (governance, environment, social). Identify patterns and gaps.
- **Cross-Reference:** Link to Andy's section and pitch for coherence.
- **Outline Draft:** Sketch structure based on findings.

### 4. Writing and Drafting (Week 4)

- **Write Section:** 800-1200 words; incorporate citations, balance perspectives.
- **First Draft:** Include intro, body (impacts/recommendations), conclusion.

### 5. Review, Revisions, and Submission (Week 5)

- **Internal Review:** Share with Andy for feedback; fact-check and revise.
- **Finalize:** Polish and submit to C&EN.

## Resources Needed

- **Budget:** Travel to Lagos/Kano/Kogi (~$500-1000); transcription services.
- **Tools:** Recording device, camera; access to databases (e.g., IFC reports).
- **Support:** Andy for chemistry insights; local contacts from pitch.
- **Ethics:** Obtain informed consent for interviews; protect vulnerable communities.

## Timeline (Condensed to 5 Weeks)

- **Total Duration:** 5 weeks (adjusted for tight deadline; focus on essentials).
- **Milestones:** End of Week 1 (prep and initial interviews done), Week 2 (field research complete), Week 3 (analysis done), Week 4 (draft ready), Week 5 (final review and submission).

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Access Issues:** Communities wary of outsiders; mitigate by partnering with local NGOs.
- **Bias:** Potential pro-government slant; balance with multiple sources.
- **Data Gaps:** Incomplete responses; supplement with public reports.
- **Health/Safety:** Site visits near refinery; use PPE and local guides.

This plan ensures Ola’s section is investigative, evidence-based, and aligned with the pitch’s aim to provide a critical view of Dangote’s impact.
