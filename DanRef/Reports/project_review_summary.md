**Final Summary of Project Review and Analysis**

**Project Overview:**
The Dangote Refinery pitch project involves creating two C&EN articles: one on chemistry/economics (Andy Extance), one on governance/environment (Ola’ Arowolo). Total 2000 words, with Ola earning $2000. Key themes include the refinery's economic benefits (self-sufficiency, exports), environmental challenges (gas flaring, climate goals), technological innovations, and social issues (evictions, flood risks). Research papers support these by discussing climate impacts, emission reductions, catalysts, and flood vulnerabilities, emphasizing sustainable practices for long-term viability.

**Risk Assessment:**
Risks are categorized as operational (e.g., delays in interviews, collaboration breakdowns), financial (e.g., non-payment), legal (e.g., defamation), reputational (e.g., backlash), technical (e.g., data loss), and security (e.g., cyber threats). Most are medium/low level. Mitigations include scheduling buffers, fact-checking, secure tools, and regular check-ins. Overall, the project is feasible with proactive monitoring.

**Engagement Recommendation:**
Recommends hiring a local Nigerian journalist for on-ground access, credibility, and risk reduction. Budget $1000-1500; select based on experience, no conflicts. Alternatives: virtual interviews if budget is an issue.

**Research Papers Exploration:**
The folder has 18 files (PDFs and .txt summaries). Key insights from Climaterisks.txt: Climate risks (physical and transition) exacerbate Nigeria's balance-of-payments issues, increasing exchange rate volatility, reducing foreign exchange income, and forcing high interest rates. This hinders diversification and green transitions, amplifying oil dependence vulnerabilities. Other papers cover air quality, aromatisation, flood risks, zero-emission strategies, hydrogen use, catalysts, and renewable materials, providing technical depth for the pitch's environmental focus.

**Key Stakeholders:**
From the contacts file, relevant team members with expertise for the project (focusing on environment, safety, process). The table below outlines how each can benefit the project, particularly from the governance/environment perspective (Ola’ Arowolo's side), by providing insights into environmental impacts, safety, sustainability, and community relations.

| Stakeholder | Expertise | How They Can Benefit the Project |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Nwogu Victor Chinedu** | HSE Engineer: Process safety, risk assessment, ISO 45001, NEBOSH. | Can provide firsthand data on health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks at the refinery, including gas flaring mitigation and compliance with international standards, strengthening the environmental governance narrative and addressing safety concerns in affected communities. |
| **Aishah Talabi** | QA Officer: Industrial chemistry, sustainable energy, environmental chemistry. | Offers expertise in quality assurance for sustainable practices, such as reducing emissions and integrating renewable energy, which can support arguments for the refinery's role in Nigeria's green transition and counter criticisms of environmental harm. |
| **Jeremiah Peter** | Chemical Engineer: AIChE member, produced water society, QHSES certified. | Can contribute insights on chemical processes, produced water management, and HSE certifications, helping to highlight technological solutions for environmental challenges like water pollution and emissions, aligning with the pitch's focus on equitable development. |
| **Mistura Yusuf** | Process Engineer: Chemical engineering, water treatment, education. | Provides knowledge on commissioning processes, water treatment systems, and community education initiatives, which can illustrate the refinery's efforts in environmental stewardship and social responsibility, including addressing flood risks and community evictions. |

**Set Up Communication Channels:**
To clarify project expectations and roles, suggest emailing these stakeholders (using provided details if available) or scheduling virtual meetings. For example, contact Nwogu for HSE insights, Aishah for sustainability, Jeremiah for chemical expertise, and Mistura for process and community perspectives. Confirm with the project lead (likely Andy or Ola) on your role and responsibilities. Use secure channels like encrypted email to avoid security risks.
