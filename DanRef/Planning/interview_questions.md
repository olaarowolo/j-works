# Interview Questions for Dangote Refinery Story

Based on the checklist and existing question documents (questions.doc, stakeholder_questions.md), here are tailored questions for the 2 Dangote experts and 1 local critic. Questions focus on HSE, sustainability, processes, environmental pollution, displacement, and unfulfilled promises, aligned with the pitch's themes.

## For Dangote Experts (Jeremiah Peter and Mistura Yusuf)

### HSE and Sustainability
- How does Dangote ensure compliance with international HSE standards (e.g., ISO 45001) in refinery operations, particularly regarding gas flaring and emissions reduction?
- What specific technologies or processes are used to mitigate environmental impacts like air pollution and water contamination from produced water?
- How does the company address climate risks, such as flooding in Lagos, in its sustainability planning?

### Processes and Expansion
- Can you describe the key chemical processes in the refinery, including any innovations like catalysts for cleaner production?
- With the announced 50% capacity expansion to 1.4 million b/d, what new chemical products (beyond polypropylene) will be produced, and how will this impact exports?
- Will the expansion include more chemical production, possibly chemicals beyond the polypropylene that they now make?
- How does Dangote balance economic growth with environmental stewardship during expansion?

### "At a Glance" Box Details (for Visuals)
- When was the refinery completed?
- What was the cost of construction?
- How many employees does the refinery have?
- What is the current refining capacity?
- What is the chemical output (e.g., types and volumes)?
- What is the scope of the expansion (e.g., percentage increase, new facilities)?

## For Local Critic (Mrs. Funmilayo Adeyemi, Lekki Coastal Womenâ€™s Forum)

### Environmental Pollution and Displacement
- How has the refinery's operation affected local fishing and farming livelihoods, and what evidence of pollution (e.g., water or air quality) have you observed?
- What promises were made in the 2007 MOU regarding compensation, jobs, and infrastructure, and how many have been fulfilled?
- How do you view the refinery's role in Nigeria's climate goals, given reports of increased health risks like respiratory issues?

### Community and Governance
- What role should communities like Lekki have in future industrial projects to prevent issues like forced evictions?
- How can Dangote better engage with local stakeholders to address criticisms of inadequate support and transparency?

## Additional Interviewees for Remaining Questions

Based on stakeholder_questions.md, here are suggestions for who to ask the remaining questions not covered in the tailored list above. These can be assigned to additional contacts if needed for a more comprehensive story.

### For Government Officials (e.g., Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, NADDC)
- How is the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency monitoring and enforcing air, water, and soil quality standards around the Dangote refinery?
- Given Nigeria's pledge to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2030, how does the government plan to address gas flaring at the refinery?
- What measures are in place to ensure equitable compensation and resettlement for evicted communities?

### For Experts and Academics (e.g., Prof. Orish Ebere Orisakwe)
- What specific pollutants from the Dangote complex pose the greatest risks to nearby populations?
- How can Nigeria integrate renewable energy alternatives alongside fossil-heavy projects like Dangote?

### For International Bodies (e.g., IFC)
- How does the IFC evaluate and mitigate social and environmental risks in projects like the Dangote fertiliser plant?
- What role can international climate funds play in de-risking renewable energy investments in Nigeria?

These can be prioritized based on availability and story needs.

These questions are open-ended for detailed responses, drawing from research papers and news stories for credibility.
