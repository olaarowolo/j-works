# Interview Questions for Dangote Refinery Story

Based on the checklist and existing question documents (questions.doc, stakeholder_questions.md), here are tailored questions for the 2 Dangote experts and 1 local critic. Questions focus on HSE, sustainability, processes, environmental pollution, displacement, and unfulfilled promises, aligned with the pitch's themes.

## For Dangote Experts (Jeremiah Peter and Mistura Yusuf)

### HSE and Sustainability

- How does Dangote ensure compliance with international HSE standards (e.g., ISO 45001) in refinery operations, particularly regarding gas flaring and emissions reduction?
- What specific technologies or processes are used to mitigate environmental impacts like air pollution and water contamination from produced water?
- How does the company address climate risks, such as flooding in Lagos, in its sustainability planning?

### Processes and Expansion

- Can you describe the key chemical processes in the refinery, including any innovations like catalysts for cleaner production?
- With the announced 50% capacity expansion to 1.4 million b/d, what new chemical products (beyond polypropylene) will be produced, and how will this impact exports?
- Will the expansion include more chemical production, possibly chemicals beyond the polypropylene that they now make?
- How does Dangote balance economic growth with environmental stewardship during expansion?

### "At a Glance" Box Details (for Visuals)

- When was the refinery completed?
- What was the cost of construction?
- How many employees does the refinery have?
- What is the current refining capacity?
- What is the chemical output (e.g., types and volumes)?
- What is the scope of the expansion (e.g., percentage increase, new facilities)?

## For Local Critic (Mrs. Funmilayo Adeyemi, Lekki Coastal Womenâ€™s Forum)

### Environmental Pollution and Displacement

- What has been your experience with the refinery?
- What do you know about the promises made in the 2007 MOU?
- What is your view on the refinery's role in Nigeria's climate goals?

### Community and Governance

- What role should communities like Lekki have in future industrial projects to prevent issues like forced evictions?
- How can Dangote better engage with local stakeholders to address criticisms of inadequate support and transparency?

### Note on Question Revisions

The questions for the local critic have been revised to be more open-ended and avoid priming the respondent. Original questions that suggested specific topics (e.g., effects on livelihoods, details of promises, or assumptions about climate roles) were removed or broadened to allow the critic to respond freely without being directed.

* The refinery's operation affected local fishing and farming livelihoods, and what evidence of pollution (e.g., water or air quality)

## Additional Interviewees for Remaining Questions

Based on stakeholder_questions.md, here are suggestions for who to ask the remaining questions not covered in the tailored list above. These can be assigned to additional contacts if needed for a more comprehensive story.

### For Government Officials (e.g., Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, NADDC)

- How is the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency monitoring and enforcing air, water, and soil quality standards around the Dangote refinery?
- Given Nigeria's pledge to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2030, how does the government plan to address gas flaring at the refinery?
- What measures are in place to ensure equitable compensation and resettlement for evicted communities?

### For Experts and Academics (e.g., Prof. Orish Ebere Orisakwe)

- What specific pollutants from the Dangote complex pose the greatest risks to nearby populations?
- How can Nigeria integrate renewable energy alternatives alongside fossil-heavy projects like Dangote?

### For International Bodies (e.g., IFC)

- How does the IFC evaluate and mitigate social and environmental risks in projects like the Dangote fertiliser plant?
- What role can international climate funds play in de-risking renewable energy investments in Nigeria?

These can be prioritized based on availability and story needs.

These questions are open-ended for detailed responses, drawing from research papers and news stories for credibility.
