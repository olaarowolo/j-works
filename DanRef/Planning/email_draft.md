Hi Andy and Editor,

I hope you’re both keeping well.

I wanted to share a quick update on developments and next steps. I’ve been working behind the scenes to move things forward and have had a few promising conversations recently that are shaping the direction of this story.

Most notably, Dangote himself held a press conference announcing a 50% expansion of the refinery’s capacity — from 650,000 barrels per day to 1.4 million barrels per day. This would position the refinery as the largest in the world, surpassing the current record-holder in India. It’s a major development that significantly strengthens the narrative.

In addition, I’ve reached out to several experts who can provide valuable insights. I’ve listed them below, along with notes on how each could enrich the story. I’ve already established direct contact with one, while discussions with the remaining three are underway.

**Key Stakeholders and Their Potential Contributions:**

- **Nwogu Victor Chinedu** (Principal Officer HSE Engineer, Dangote Petroleum Refinery): Can provide firsthand data on health, safety, and environmental (HSE) risks at the refinery, including gas flaring mitigation and compliance with international standards, strengthening the environmental governance narrative and addressing safety concerns in affected communities.
  
- **Aishah Talabi** (Quality Assurance Officer, Dangote Refinery): Offers expertise in quality assurance for sustainable practices, such as reducing emissions and integrating renewable energy, which can support arguments for the refinery's role in Nigeria's green transition and counter criticisms of environmental harm.
  
- **Jeremiah Peter** (Chemical Engineer, Dangote Petroleum Refinery): Can contribute insights on chemical processes, produced water management, and HSE certifications, helping to highlight technological solutions for environmental challenges like water pollution and emissions, aligning with the pitch's focus on equitable development.
  
- **Mistura Yusuf** (Commissioning and Process/Production Engineer, Dangote Petroleum Refinery): Provides knowledge on commissioning processes, water treatment systems, and community education initiatives, which can illustrate the refinery's efforts in environmental stewardship and social responsibility, including addressing flood risks and community evictions.

Please share your thoughts when you can, so we can finalise our approach and begin the next phase in earnest.

Andy, I did further research on the model you shared, and I drew a cleaner one. Let me know how useful this is (see attached).

Warm regards,

Olasunkanmi Arowolo
