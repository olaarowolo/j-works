Interviewee: M.Y

Interviewee: I officially joined in March 2020, according to the documents, and I resigned in November 2020. While I was there, I was fortunate to work in different units, but my major role was as an engineer. When I resigned, we were still in the phase of commissioning. So, I had to work in various units simultaneously. I also monitored the main-point processes, checked the operators' design, and observed the contractors' efficiency in carrying out their duties. I worked in the water and basic utilities sections, including water treatment, the reverse osmosis plant, the demineralization plant (or de-min plant), the nitrogen generation plant, and so on. 

Interviewer: All right, thank you for that context.
Interviewer: So now, how does Dangote ensure compliance with the HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment) standards in refinery operations? Are their operations complying, particularly regarding gas flaring? In a previous interview, locals confirmed that gas is being flared-burning of gas and more. So are they complying with this?

Interviewee: When it comes to HSE, the departments that deal with it are mainly concerned with documentation and staffing. I'd say compliance is very minimal. I wouldn't even give it a ratio. When I was leaving the refinery, we were not yet audited to the full HSE standard. The only plants that had started operation were the power generation plants. It’s normal for a start-up plant to have outstanding issues, like in terms of revenue or plant debts.
But when you consider the actual standards-the health of those watching the process-I would say compliance is minimal. When I arrived, I purchased my own PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) after the plant was running-things like helmets and safety boots. Though we did have a senior manager who ensured these things were provided for us before I arrived, I don't know if that is still ongoing.
When it comes to the contractors, they put it on paper that people should wear their PPE, but you see welders working without proper equipment. This speaks volumes about compliance.
And when you come to the risk assessment, people conduct them, but they aren't truly conducting them because when you focus on the work, you see the gaps. PPE should be the last line of defense, not the first. If all other safety measures are in place, the chance of things going wrong should be so minimal that PPE is just a safeguard. It should not be the first point of call in a hazardous zone.
So yes, the safety practice is not really good, but I would say it was still early; they were trying to stabilize things.
Regarding the fertilizer plant, I didn't work there, but from my visits, I know the environment was a concern. People living in the area complained that they couldn't breathe properly. There are ongoing lawsuits because the smell in the environment is not consistent (i.e., it's frequently bad). I can only factor this in from my knowledge that it was the fertilizer plant that was impacting the environment. Now that the refinery has truly started operations, compliance is critical to making things work perfectly. All right, thank you very much.
Interviewer: So now, how does this fertilizer particularly, how does it work, how does it affect the environment, how does it produce the environment? Can you just, in a very simple way, that readers can understand?
Interviewee: To make fertilizer, you need several components. The process is very reactive, and it gives off a distinct smell. To simplify, let's imagine you need to make urea. To get urea, you definitely need ammonia, which is a functional group. You source the ammonia from natural gas, and then you combine it with the products of other lighter gases. After processing, it's made into pellets-small, solid forms-for packaging.
In that kind of manufacturing environment, you are exposed to substances like ammonia. Ammonia has a very pungent smell; it's an irritant. Obviously, anything that creates an irritating environment is not generally good for people. So, the fact that people are working in such an environment-where perhaps the safety notes are not adhered to, and proper precautions are not taken-is a huge concern, not just for the workers, but also for the surrounding communities. It can be a very big problem. All right. Thank you very much for that.
Interviewer: Now, with the announced 50% capacity expansion, just last week, from 650 to 1.4 million barrels per day, what new chemical products, beyond the polypropylene, will be produced, and how will this possibly impact exports?
Interviewer: What specific technologies and processes are used to mitigate the environmental impact, like air pollution and water contamination from the produced water, during the fertilizer production process and more?
Interviewee: I can’t speak specifically about the fertilizer process, but I know the refinery has water treatment plants. The original plan was for the wastewater from the fertilizer plant to be channeled to the refinery’s treatment plant, because the refinery has a very large and sophisticated treatment system. The water would be treated to the extent that it could be safely released into the main water body.
However, the fertilizer plant started operating before the refinery’s water treatment plant was fully operational.
For the refinery itself, there is a water treatment plant, but does that mean no waste is going out? No, there is always wastewater at the end of the day. We remove the impurities from the process water. This filtered water is reused, and the remaining wastewater is disposed of. We call it wastewater because it no longer meets the standards for reuse.
When it is released into the main water body, the specification on paper states that the treated water should actually be in a cleaner state than the water body it is being released into. The design intent is for the plant not to pollute the water. Oh. So, it means the wastewater going out should theoretically be cleaner than the water body it enters. Yes. Yes. That's the plan. That's what is on paper. All right. Thank you.
Interviewee: But, the information I got from those working in the fertilizer plant was that the wastewater was supposed to be channeled to the refinery for final, proper treatment, making the refinery the final exit point to the water body. Given that the fertilizer plant started well before the refinery's final exit was ready, the question remains: where was the wastewater from the fertilizer plant released to? That's a very good question. All right. Thank you.
Interviewee: The fertilizer and refinery plants are located very close to a small lagoon (a confined water body) which is fresh water-not saltwater. We prefer to source our water from this lake, treat it, and then the final treated discharge goes to the saltwater body. The plant’s design on paper, and the constructed system, would ensure the treated water release is very clean.
However, I believe some issues occurred. There were tests done, and what we can say is that the fertilizer plant was releasing water into this freshwater lake, which was not supposed to happen. This means the water was already polluted. And I think people said there were issues where a layer of heat was floating on the water because of the pollution. Yes, all right. Thank you so much for that.
Interviewer: So, now how does the company address climate risk such as flooding?
Interviewee: I really cannot say anything about that because, as I said, the area is located between two water bodies. Before this plant was built, there was a big kind of dike and everything to control the water inflow and all. So, I don't have information about flooding. All right. Thank you so much for that.
Interviewer: So, in terms of process and expansion, can you describe the key chemical processes in the refinery, including any innovation such as catalysts for clean production?
Interviewee: The refinery aims to meet high standards, such as the Euro-5 (or E-05) standard for gasoline, which is the equivalent of premium gasoline. First, the crude oil (which contains water and various contaminants) must be separated. All contaminants and excess water are removed before the oil is sent for processing. Only the non-condensable hydrocarbon components are flared.
The oil goes through pre-treatment, which uses heat to remove salts and excess water before it is separated in the Distillation Column (the CDU, or Crude Distillation Unit). This is the main feed unit. When the oil is separated, the heavy, bottom part-which would normally be considered waste-is sent to the IRCC (Integrated Residue Catalytic Cracking) unit.
The IRCC is often called a 'cash cow'. This bottom-of-the-barrel waste is 'blown up' or severely cracked inside the unit. What was once very thick becomes much lighter. This allows you to get an output almost equivalent to what you get from the CDU, but in multiple batches. Essentially, it amplifies the profit and output from a material that would typically be waste.
This cracking process is done using a catalyst, which makes the reaction much easier and faster.
You get the base output, and then various units help to refine and blend it. For example, gasoline is not a single product; it is a blend of seven different components. There are several units dedicated to cleaning and blending to get that exact result that you need.
There is the Hydrogen Generation Plant, as hydrogen is needed to separate or purify many substances.
You will need the Sulfur Recovery Plant, which helps remove sulfur-a major contaminant. This removed sulfur can then be stored or sold to other companies that specialize in its use (for fertilizer, soaps, cosmetics, etc.).
Then there is also the Polypropylene Plant, which processes part of the output into polypropylene.
So, like I said earlier, this refinery is designed to contain all of these things. We also have the Nitrogen Generation Plant where nitrogen is produced, and the excess oxygen can be released into the atmosphere, which helps balance the output-you are not just taking from the environment, you are also giving back. Well, that's interesting.
Interviewer: I'm going to share an image of a model of the process of the catalyst and you tell me what is unique about Dangote and how it is different and maybe after this interview. So I just don't want to break the flow. So now, they announced 50%. I can understand that from the waste they feed it back into the system, it's a sort of double the production. Could that explain the increments of the output from 650 to 1.4 million barrels?
Interviewee: No, no, that doesn't explain it. The refinery is currently designed to accommodate 650,000 barrels per day (BPD). The 1.4 million figure mentioned in the press conference by Dangote is likely about efficiency and maximizing the output from the input. I’m not currently working there, so I don’t know what changes they've made to achieve that, but there are several ways it can be done.
Interviewer: So with this increments in 50% capacity expansion to 1.4 million. So what new chemical products beyond the polypropylene? Okay, polypropylene will be produced. What new chemicals will be beyond that polypropylene that will be produced? How will it impact exports?
Interviewee: Yes, it's actually a good cash cow for the industry. The refinery is designed to reuse and convert everything so that nothing leaves as waste. So that’s why they are trying to utilize everything that comes out. The 1.4 million BPD figure primarily relates to the amount of refined oil produced, and this, in turn, will increase the output of polypropylene.
Polypropylene is essentially plastic (in layman’s terms).
Interviewer: Now, how is this going to be managed? Is it going to be sorted into the markets that needs this or back into the refined oil?
Interviewee: It's going to be sorted into the markets that need it. The refinery does not have the capacity for now to process it further. You can actually use polypropylene for plastic bags and other products, depending on how it's blended. It will be up to them to decide if it's best for export or for the domestic market.
Interviewer: So speaking in terms of chemical, this expansion will require more chemical production. Impossible more chemicals beyond the polypropylene that are now making.
Interviewee: More chemical production? Yes. In what sense like?
Interviewer: Now would they require more chemical? Would they be requiring more chemicals? And also their process will be leading to production of further chemicals?
Interviewee: It may just be like an increased demand for the chemicals they already use. And obviously, you will need more catalysts.
Interviewer: How do you explain this catalyst? And you simplify it. And what is that catalyst that you use?
Interviewee: I can't give you the exact commercial name of the catalyst they use (no one would give that out).
Interviewer: Thank you. So how does Dangote balance economic growth with environmental stewardship? Do you have any information around that?
Interviewer: Now if you talk about economic growth, definitely their contribution is going to be to the Nigerian economy, I mean, African economy. And by boosting to 1.4 million barrels per day, the world's largest refinery, which will be second in the world, Dangote will be in position as number one. Definitely is contributing to economic growth. Now in terms of environmental stewardship, the production of all of these chemical products and processing will definitely in one way or the other have an impact on society. Like the local authorities have mentioned that there is an open fire burning right there in front of the refinery. There's a gas flaring clearly from what they've mentioned. And there have been a number of accidents of tankers, explosion of gas tankers, that has even cost the people more for mobility. So I'm just asking now, in terms of environmental stewardship, all of these talk about stewardship. And it's already looking like in the negative. But is there any plans for putting this thing in a very positive light to become a good steward of environmental resources?
Interviewee: This conversation is probably best answered by Dangote’s management. They will likely counter negative feedback by mentioning their community support, projects, or charitable actions. I cannot say for sure.
What I know is that, generally, safety is often compromised, especially with contractors. We see people coming to work without proper safety protocols, and no one takes responsibility. When it comes to the environmental issues-like the constant gas flaring mentioned by locals, and the fatal gas tanker explosions near the site-no one takes responsibility for the accidents or the environmental impact.
Based on what I’ve seen, I don't believe they are fully demonstrating good environmental stewardship. They have been able to manage other complex projects, so they should be able to replicate that here, but I haven't seen it happen. All right, thank you for that.
Interviewer: So going to health and safety again, and then just two questions for us to wrap up. What are the known health impacts of the refinery emission on the nearby population?
Interviewee: Basically, the emissions affect the water body, which impacts the livelihood of those who rely on it for fishing. You also get various toxic substances and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)-unseen contaminants-flying around in the atmosphere. It’s like saying the person who constantly stays near a smoke chimney is at risk of poor health.
Interviewer: So now are there chances that there will be respiratory issues beyond this and then also cancer risk?
Interviewee: There are certain chemicals and processes in the refinery that are considered carcinogenic. We try not to use the most dangerous chemicals, but there are different types of cancer-lung, blood, etc.-and we don't always know the specific causes. Anything that affects your lungs will be related to what you are breathing in. To determine a direct link, you would have to go beyond chemistry and look into the reaction of these particles within the human body. All of these foreign particles entering the body are an adversary to one’s health. All right.
Interviewer: So my last question. How does the refinery address biodiversity loss and flood risk in coastal areas? Because it's located within the coastal environments.
Interviewee: Regarding flooding, I can't say if there has really been any issue like that.
Interviewer: How about that biodiversity loss? So the fish is dying, they're located in the habitat. They are no longer available for people who are the locals who fish for a living. So the nature and natural habitat has been sort of... Yes, definitely. So yeah, definitely top malaria. Yes, so are they addressing these kind of issues? And also importantly, there are claims from my, in today's interview, that the quality of soil is being depleted. And the buildings are collapsing because of the dredging. So these are concerns.
Interviewee: The claims about the environment are likely correct. The refinery is built on a marshy, waterlogged environment. I can't imagine someone building a regular structure there that would also be subjected to the constant vibrations of an industrial plant. While I can't confirm a direct link, I'm simply providing an analogy for why those collapses might occur.
As for biodiversity loss, the refinery has a port where ships dock to load and offload products like fertilizer and crude oil. While the crude offloading is done offshore at a Single Point Mooring (SPM), the very presence of a port and these large ships, with their engines and disturbance, drives away the aquatic life. The noise and disturbance will cause the fish and other sea life, which normally come close to the shore, to leave their habitat. This makes it difficult for local fishermen.
The fact that the government has opened this area as a Free Trade Zone has led to increased vessel traffic, making the environment more vulnerable.
Interviewer: Okay, thank you so much for your time. I've been well educated in this interview. So is there any other thing you would like to add from your experience that you think will be useful?
Interviewee: I think the compliance team, perhaps from the state's environmental agency, needs to do more hands-on work. They shouldn't just sit and listen to what the company tells them. They need to conduct deep, comprehensive audits and speak to the locals and people directly affected, rather than just being told what they want to hear. Thank you.










Summary
Employment Context: Interviewee M.Y. worked as an engineer at the refinery from March to November 2020, involved in various units including water treatment, reverse osmosis, demineralization, and nitrogen generation plants.
HSE Compliance: Compliance with Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) standards was described as minimal. PPE provision was inconsistent, and contractors often ignored safety protocols. Risk assessments were conducted but not effectively implemented.
Environmental Concerns: The fertilizer plant was noted for causing air quality issues, with locals complaining about breathing difficulties and ongoing lawsuits due to environmental impact.
Fertilizer Production: Fertilizer (e.g., urea) is produced using ammonia sourced from natural gas. The process emits strong odors and exposes workers and communities to irritants like ammonia.
Water Treatment and Pollution: Wastewater from the fertilizer plant was supposed to be treated at the refinery, but the fertilizer plant began operations before the refinery’s treatment system was ready. This led to polluted water being released into a nearby freshwater lake, causing visible environmental damage.
Flooding and Climate Risk: The interviewee had limited information on flood risk but noted the presence of dikes and water control structures in the area
Refinery Processes and Expansion: The refinery uses advanced processes like catalytic cracking (IRCC) to maximize output and meet Euro-5 gasoline standards. Expansion aims to increase capacity from 650,000 to 1.4 million barrels per day, mainly by improving efficiency.
Chemical Products: Polypropylene is a major product, with increased output expected from expansion. The refinery sorts products for export or domestic use, but further chemical production will likely involve greater demand for catalysts.
Economic Growth vs. Environmental Stewardship: While the refinery contributes to economic growth, environmental stewardship is lacking. Issues include gas flaring, tanker explosions, and poor safety practices, with little accountability for environmental impacts.
Health Impacts: Emissions affect water bodies and local livelihoods, with risks of respiratory issues and cancer due to exposure to toxic substances and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
Biodiversity and Habitat Loss: The refinery’s location and operations (including port activities and vessel traffic) disrupt aquatic life and local fishing, contributing to biodiversity loss. Soil quality and building stability are also affected by dredging and industrial vibrations.
Recommendations: The interviewee suggests that environmental agencies should conduct thorough, hands-on audits and engage directly with affected communities rather than relying solely on company reports
