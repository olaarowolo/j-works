# Interview Questions for Mistura Yusuf

## Introduction

Mistura Yusuf is a key expert at Dangote Industries Limited, offering perspectives on the refinery's operational and environmental strategies. As part of the investigative story on the Dangote Refinery's governance and environmental challenges, these questions aim to explore HSE standards, sustainability practices, and the refinery's processes and expansion plans.

## Context

The Dangote Refinery, Africa's largest, is a cornerstone of Nigeria's energy transition, but it faces scrutiny over environmental impacts and social disruptions. Mistura's responses will help illuminate how the refinery mitigates pollution, addresses climate risks, and balances growth with stewardship, drawing from research on refinery pollutants and health consequences.

Based on the checklist and existing question documents (questions.doc, stakeholder_questions.md), here are tailored questions for Mistura Yusuf. Questions focus on HSE, sustainability, processes, environmental pollution, displacement, and unfulfilled promises, aligned with the pitch's themes.

### HSE and Sustainability

- How does Dangote ensure compliance with international HSE standards (e.g., ISO 45001) in refinery operations, particularly regarding gas flaring and emissions reduction?
- What specific technologies or processes are used to mitigate environmental impacts like air pollution and water contamination from produced water?
- How does the company address climate risks, such as flooding in Lagos, in its sustainability planning?

### Processes and Expansion

- Can you describe the key chemical processes in the refinery, including any innovations like catalysts for cleaner production?
- With the announced 50% capacity expansion to 1.4 million b/d, what new chemical products (beyond polypropylene) will be produced, and how will this impact exports?
- Will the expansion include more chemical production, possibly chemicals beyond the polypropylene that they now make?
- How does Dangote balance economic growth with environmental stewardship during expansion?

### Health Risks and Ecosystem Effects

- What are the known health impacts of refinery emissions on nearby populations, such as respiratory issues or cancer risks?
- How does the refinery address biodiversity loss and flood risks in coastal areas?

These questions are open-ended for detailed responses, drawing from research papers and news stories for credibility.
