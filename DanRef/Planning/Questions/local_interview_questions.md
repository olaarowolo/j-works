# Interview Questions for Local Critics

## Introduction

Local critics, including community leaders and activists from affected areas like Lekki, provide firsthand perspectives on the social and environmental impacts of the Dangote Refinery. As part of the investigative story on the refinery's governance and environmental challenges, these questions aim to capture community voices on displacement, pollution, and unfulfilled promises, highlighting the human side of industrial development.

## Context

The Dangote Refinery, Africa's largest, is a cornerstone of Nigeria's energy transition, but it has led to evictions, livelihood disruptions, and environmental concerns in coastal communities. Responses from local critics will illustrate the social costs, including cultural heritage losses and governance issues, contrasting with the refinery's economic benefits and offering a balanced view for the article.

Based on the checklist and existing question documents (questions.doc, stakeholder_questions.md), here are tailored questions for local critics, focusing on HSE, sustainability, processes, environmental pollution, displacement, and unfulfilled promises, aligned with the pitch's themes.

## For Local Critic (Mrs. Funmilayo Adeyemi, Lekki Coastal Women’s Forum)

### Environmental Pollution and Displacement

- What has been your experience with the refinery?
- What do you know about the promises made in the 2007 MOU?
- What is your view on the refinery's role in Nigeria's climate goals?

### Community and Governance

- What role should communities like Lekki have in future industrial projects to prevent issues like forced evictions?
- How can Dangote better engage with local stakeholders to address criticisms of inadequate support and transparency?
- How have evictions affected traditional livelihoods and cultural ties to the land?

## For Youth Leader (President of National Youth Council of Nigeria)

### Youth Perspectives and Future Generations

- As a youth leader, how do you see the Dangote Refinery impacting the future job opportunities and economic development for young Nigerians?
- What concerns do young people in Nigeria have regarding environmental sustainability and climate change in relation to large-scale industrial projects like the Dangote Refinery?
- How can the refinery contribute to youth empowerment and skill development in the energy sector?

### Community and Social Impact

- In your experience, what are the social effects of the refinery on local communities, particularly on youth and education?
- What role should youth organizations play in monitoring and advocating for responsible industrial practices in Nigeria?

### Note on Question Revisions

The questions for the local critic have been revised to be more open-ended and avoid priming the respondent. Original questions that suggested specific topics (e.g., effects on livelihoods, details of promises, or assumptions about climate roles) were removed or broadened to allow the critic to respond freely without being directed.

* The refinery's operation affected local fishing and farming livelihoods, and what evidence of pollution (e.g., water or air quality)
