# Extra Interview Questions for Abiodun Alade (Based on Identified Gaps)

## Introduction
These additional questions are drafted to address gaps identified in the transcript alignment report for Ola's section on Governance and Environmental Challenges of the Dangote Refinery. The gaps include limited emphasis on international benchmarks, flood risks in coastal areas, and specific technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) for gas flaring or grid modernization for renewables. These questions aim to provide balanced perspectives on policy responses, recommendations, and global comparisons, enhancing the investigative depth of the article.

## Extra Questions

### International Benchmarks and Policy Comparisons
- How does Dangote Refinery's environmental and HSE practices compare to international standards in refineries in the US or Europe, particularly regarding gas flaring bans and emissions controls? What lessons from these benchmarks has the company adopted or plans to implement?
- In what ways does Dangote contribute to global climate goals, such as the Paris Agreement, and how does it benchmark against other emerging economies' refineries in balancing fossil fuel production with low-carbon transitions?

### Flood Risks and Coastal Ecosystem Impacts
- What measures has Dangote taken to address flood risks in the coastal Lekki area, given the refinery's location between water bodies and potential exacerbation by climate change? How does the company collaborate with local authorities on flood mitigation?
- How does the refinery assess and mitigate broader ecosystem effects, such as biodiversity loss and wetland impacts in coastal areas, and what role does it play in regional climate resilience efforts?

### Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Renewable Integration
- What is Dangote's strategy for implementing Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to reduce gas flaring, and how does this align with Nigeria's 20% GHG emission cut target by 2030? Are there pilot projects or partnerships in place?
- How does the company plan to integrate renewables and modernize the grid to support clean transport initiatives, such as CNG distribution or EV infrastructure, and what challenges does it face in transitioning from fossil dependency?

These questions are designed to be open-ended, encouraging detailed responses that provide corporate perspectives on the gaps. They can be integrated into the existing interview guide for Abiodun Alade to ensure comprehensive coverage for Ola's section.
