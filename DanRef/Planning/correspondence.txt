Hi Ola,

Thanks for this update. I agree that the expansion announcement provides a good hook for the story! I am interested to know if the expansion will include more chemical production, possibly chemicals beyond the polypropylene that they now make.

It's good that you are contacting experts at the Dangote refinery but I don't think we will need all 4 of them to talk about ways in which Dangote is trying to be a good social and environmental steward. Two of them is probably enough, balanced with a local critic of the project.

Regarding the illustration, that looks to me like a typical refinery flow chart. Rather than run that let's plan on photos and an "At a Glance" box about the refinery that includes information such as:

When completed
Cost of construction
Employees
Refining capacity
Chemical output
Scope of expansion
Etc. 

Sorry if you did a lot of work on the illustration! Regards--Mike
