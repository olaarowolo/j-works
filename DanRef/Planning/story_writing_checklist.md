# Story Writing Checklist for Dangote Refinery Pitch

This checklist outlines the prioritized steps for writing the two-part story on the Dangote Refinery: one focusing on chemistry and economics (Andy Extance), and the other on governance and environment (Olasunkanmi Arowolo). Priorities are ordered from highest (most critical for foundation) to lowest, based on dependencies, deadlines, and project needs derived from all reviewed files (pitch, summaries, reports, correspondence, etc.).

## 1. Research and Background Preparation (Highest Priority)

- Review all key documents: Original pitch, pitch summary, research papers (e.g., Climaterisks.txt, Future prospects.txt, Flood risk.txt), and reports (e.g., stories relevance report, email draft).
- Confirm latest developments: Expansion announcement (50% capacity increase to 1.4 million b/d), chemical production details (beyond polypropylene), and refinery stats (completion date, cost, employees, capacity, output).
- Identify and prioritize sources: Research papers for technical/economic data, news stories (Guardian, NADDC, Bolt) for social/environmental context.
- Goal: Establish factual foundation to avoid rework.

## 2. Stakeholder Outreach and Interviews (High Priority)

- [X] Contact and schedule interviews: 2 Dangote experts for HSE, sustainability, and processes; 1 local critic for balance.
  - [ ] Nwogu Victor Chinedu
  - [ ] Aishah Talabi
  - [X] Jeremiah Peter
  - [X] Mistura Yusuf
  - [ ] Local critic: Mrs. Funmilayo Adeyemi (Lekki Coastal Womenâ€™s Forum) - environmental pollution, displacement, unfulfilled promises.
- [ ] Prepare questions: Created interview_questions.md with tailored questions for 2 Dangote experts and 1 local critic, based on questions.doc and stakeholder_questions.md.
- [ ] Conduct interviews: Virtual/in-person, record, and transcribe (timeline: 15 days as per interview_timeline.md).
- [ ] Goal: Gather primary insights for credibility and balance.

## 3. Address Editorial Feedback (High Priority)

- Incorporate Mike's feedback from correspondence.txt: Investigate expansion chemicals, limit experts to 2, include local critic, replace flow chart with photos and "At a Glance" box (details: completion, cost, employees, capacity, output, scope).
- Update todos: Ensure all items in correspondence_todos.txt are addressed (e.g., confirm expansion, contact experts/critic, design "At a Glance").
- Goal: Align with commissioning editor's vision to avoid rejection.

## 4. Outline Story Structure (Medium Priority)

- Define article structures: Andy's section (chemistry/economics: processes, competitiveness, exports); Ola's section (governance/environment: evictions, flaring, climate goals).
- Integrate themes: Link to pitch summary (e.g., climate risks, emissions tech), stories report (social impacts, clean transport), and action plan (field research, interviews).
- Goal: Clear roadmap for writing.

## 5. Write Drafts (Medium Priority)

- Draft Andy's article: Focus on refinery operations, economic impact, technological innovations (e.g., catalysts from Nickel-tolerant paper).
- Draft Ola's article: Cover social/governance issues, environmental challenges, mitigation strategies (e.g., CCS from Future prospects).
- Incorporate data: Use "At a Glance" box, quotes from interviews, citations from papers.
- Goal: Complete first drafts (800-1200 words each).

## 6. Fact-Checking and Revisions (Medium Priority)

- Verify facts: Cross-check data with sources (e.g., IFC reports, public emission data).
- Revise for balance: Ensure neutral tone, address criticisms (e.g., from Guardian story).
- Collaborate: Share drafts between Andy and Ola for coherence.
- Goal: Error-free, cohesive content.

## 7. Final Editing and Submission (Low Priority)

- [ ] Edit for style: Align with C&EN standards (technical, engaging).
- [ ] Prepare visuals: Photos, "At a Glance" box instead of illustration.
- [ ] Submit: To Mike and C&EN, with cover note on collaboration.
- [ ] Goal: Publish-ready articles.

## Notes

- Timeline: Aim for 5-6 weeks total, per ola_action_plan.md.
- Risks: Delays in interviews; mitigate by having backups.
- Resources: Budget for travel/interviews; tools for transcription/recording.
- This checklist ensures the story is comprehensive, evidence-based, and meets pitch objectives.
