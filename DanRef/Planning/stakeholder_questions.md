# Draft Questions for Stakeholders: Dangote Refinery Governance and Environmental Impact

These questions are designed for Ola’ Arowolo's investigative section on the Dangote refinery's governance and environmental footprint. They draw from research papers (e.g., Atedhor, 2025; Popoola et al., 2025; Adebiyi, 2022) and news stories (e.g., Guardian article on evictions and health risks). Questions are categorized by stakeholder type, phrased to elicit detailed, balanced responses, and include citations for credibility. Aim for open-ended, probing inquiries to uncover tensions between economic benefits and social/environmental costs.

## 1. Community Residents and Leaders (e.g., Evicted Communities in Lekki)
Focus: Personal experiences of evictions, livelihood loss, and health impacts, linking to social justice and cultural heritage.

- How have the evictions and land acquisitions for the Dangote refinery affected your community's traditional livelihoods, such as fishing and farming, and what compensation have you received compared to promises in the 2007 MOU? (Cites Guardian article on reduced catch and minimal compensation; Atedhor, 2025, on social disruptions in energy projects.)
- In what ways has the refinery's operation influenced local health outcomes, including reports of increased respiratory issues or cancer risks, and how does this align with your community's cultural views on environmental stewardship? (Cites Adebiyi, 2022, on refinery pollutants like VOCs and NOx; Guardian on proximity to refineries increasing cancer risk.)
- What role do you see for community involvement in future industrial developments to avoid the issues faced here, such as forced displacements and unfulfilled promises of jobs and infrastructure? (Cites Atedhor, 2025, on stakeholder engagement for low-carbon transitions; Popoola et al., 2025, on flood risks exacerbating vulnerabilities in coastal areas.)

## 2. Government Officials (e.g., Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, NADDC)
Focus: Regulatory enforcement, policy implementation, and balancing development with climate goals.

- How is the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency monitoring and enforcing air, water, and soil quality standards around the Dangote refinery, and what preliminary findings from recent sampling (e.g., soil and air tests) indicate about pollution levels? (Cites Adebiyi, 2022, on refinery air pollution sources; Guardian on ongoing agency investigations.)
- Given Nigeria's pledge to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2030, how does the government plan to address gas flaring at the refinery, which is banned in many countries, and integrate it with initiatives like CNG-powered transport in Kano and Kogi? (Cites Popoola et al., 2025, on future prospects for zero-emission tech; Atedhor, 2025, on contradictory fossil expansion vs. low-carbon goals.)
- What measures are in place to ensure equitable compensation and resettlement for evicted communities, and how do these align with international standards from bodies like the IFC, which funded the adjacent fertiliser plant? (Cites Guardian on IFC environmental reports underestimating impacts; Atedhor, 2025, on financial barriers and corruption in energy projects.)

## 3. Experts and Academics (e.g., Prof. Orish Ebere Orisakwe, Environmental NGOs)
Focus: Scientific analysis of environmental and health risks, policy recommendations.

- Based on studies of refinery proximity and health, what specific pollutants from the Dangote complex (e.g., VOCs, particulate matter) pose the greatest risks to nearby populations, and how do these compare to impacts in the Niger Delta? (Cites Adebiyi, 2022, on refinery pollutants and health consequences; Guardian on increased cancer risk near refineries.)
- How can Nigeria's outdated grid infrastructure and reliance on imported technologies hinder the integration of renewable energy alternatives, such as the EV tricycles launched by Bolt in Lagos, alongside fossil-heavy projects like Dangote? (Cites Atedhor, 2025, on technological challenges in low-carbon ET; Popoola et al., 2025, on hydrogen and CNG for sustainable transport.)
- What policy reforms, such as carbon pricing or subsidy shifts, would you recommend to mitigate the environmental footprint of refineries while supporting economic growth in developing economies? (Cites Atedhor, 2025, on proposed pathways like innovative financing and de-risking RE investments; Guardian on refinery emissions slowing renewables transition.)

## 4. Dangote Representatives (e.g., Company Officials)
Focus: Corporate perspective on sustainability, community relations, and future plans (if accessible).

- How does Dangote Industries address environmental concerns like gas flaring and biodiversity loss in its refinery operations, and what steps are being taken to align with Nigeria's climate targets amid expansion plans? (Cites Popoola et al., 2025, on prospects for CCS in refining; Atedhor, 2025, on fossil bias in investments.)
- What community engagement strategies has the company implemented for affected areas, including compensation and job creation, and how do these respond to criticisms of inadequate support for evicted residents? (Cites Guardian on unfulfilled MOUs and livelihood loss; Atedhor, 2025, on social challenges in energy projects.)
- In light of trends toward clean transport (e.g., CNG tricycles in Kogi), how might Dangote leverage its refining capabilities to support low-carbon fuels without perpetuating fossil dependency? (Cites Atedhor, 2025, on techno-financial pathways; NADDC/Bolt stories on CNG/EV adoption.)

## 5. International Bodies (e.g., IFC, Climate Finance Organizations)
Focus: Global standards, financing impacts, and cross-border lessons.

- How does the IFC evaluate and mitigate social and environmental risks in projects like the Dangote fertiliser plant, and what lessons from this financing can inform future refinery developments in Nigeria? (Cites Guardian on IFC's 2014 report underestimating impacts; Atedhor, 2025, on international climate financing.)
- What role can international climate funds play in de-risking renewable energy investments in Nigeria, potentially offsetting the financial barriers highlighted in fossil projects like Dangote? (Cites Atedhor, 2025, on debt burdens and innovative financing models; Popoola et al., 2025, on global support for zero-emission tech.)
- Drawing from global refinery benchmarks, how can Nigeria avoid issues like those in the US or Europe (e.g., ageing facilities) while scaling up local production, and what support is needed for transitions to renewables? (Cites Adebiyi, 2022, on international air quality guidelines; Atedhor, 2025, on grid modernization for RE integration.)
