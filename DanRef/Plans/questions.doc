Research-Driven Questions for Ola’ Arowolo's Governance/Environment Section

Based on the pitch's assignment for Ola’ Arowolo to explore cultural and governance issues, particularly environmental and social challenges related to the Dangote Refinery, here are research-driven questions that could guide his investigation. These questions are designed to be investigative, drawing from the papers and documents (e.g., Climaterisks.txt on climate risks, Flood risk.txt on property investments in flood-prone areas, and Future prospects... on emissions), while focusing on governance, environmental impacts, and societal implications. They can inform interviews, data analysis, and the article's narrative.

Governance and Policy Questions

1. How does Nigeria's regulatory framework for oil refining balance economic development with environmental protection, and what gaps exist in enforcing climate policies like the Paris Agreement in the context of large-scale projects like Dangote?
   Relevance: Ties into Climaterisks.txt's discussion of balance-of-payments constraints and the need for policies that consider foreign exchange dependence in the Global South for equitable climate transitions (Climaterisks.txt).

2. What role do international investors and lenders (e.g., through green financing) play in shaping governance around emissions-intensive projects like Dangote, and how can they enforce stricter environmental standards?
   Relevance: Connects to Future prospects... on the need for government-backed incentives and international collaborations to fund GHG reduction technologies (Popoola et al., 2025).

3. How have past refinery projects in Nigeria (e.g., foreign-owned ones) influenced current governance models, and what lessons can be applied to Dangote to avoid issues like corruption or hostage situations?
   Relevance: Directly from the pitch's mention of foreign-owned complexes in remote areas and the need to evade such issues (Extance & Arowolo, 2025).

Environmental Impact Questions

4. Given Nigeria's history of gas flaring, how can Dangote integrate carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen-based technologies to achieve net-zero emissions, and what barriers (e.g., cost, infrastructure) hinder adoption?
   Relevance: Builds on Future prospects... which highlights CCS and hydrogen utilization as key strategies for refineries, and the pitch's note on gas flaring as a banned practice elsewhere (Popoola et al., 2025; Extance & Arowolo, 2025).

5. How do climate risks, such as increased flooding in Lagos, interact with the refinery's operations and surrounding communities, and what mitigation strategies (e.g., infrastructure improvements) are planned?
   Relevance: Draws from Flood risk.txt's analysis of property investments in flood-prone areas and the pitch's mention of forced evictions and environmental challenges (Oyetunji et al., 2025; Extance & Arowolo, 2025).

6. What are the long-term environmental trade-offs of scaling up refining in Nigeria, particularly regarding biodiversity, air quality, and contributions to global warming, and how do they align with national climate goals?
   Relevance: Informed by Climaterisks.txt's insights on physical and transition risks exacerbating economic instability, and the pitch's concern about meeting climate goals while expanding refining (Climaterisks.txt; Extance & Arowolo, 2025).

Social and Cultural Questions

7. How have community displacements and evictions for the Dangote site affected local livelihoods and cultural heritage in Lagos, and what compensation or resettlement programs are in place?
   Relevance: Directly addresses the pitch's reference to forced evictions and social challenges, linking to Flood risk.txt's ethical considerations in stakeholder surveys (Extance & Arowolo, 2025; Oyetunji et al., 2025).

8. In what ways can the refinery promote economic diversification and green transitions in Nigeria, reducing dependence on oil while addressing social inequalities exacerbated by climate change?
   Relevance: Echoes Climaterisks.txt's call for policies that enable equitable climate transitions and hinder economic diversification, as well as the pitch's focus on reshaping Africa's oil economy (Climaterisks.txt; Extance & Arowolo, 2025).

9. How do cultural attitudes toward environmental stewardship in Nigeria influence public acceptance of projects like Dangote, and what role can education and community engagement play in fostering sustainable practices?
   Relevance: Ties into the pitch's interdisciplinary elements and the need for awareness on global warming effects, as noted in Future prospects.... (Extance & Arowolo, 2025; Popoola et al., 2025).

These questions can help Ola’ structure his research, potentially through interviews with stakeholders (e.g., government officials, environmental NGOs, local communities), data from reports, and site visits. They ensure the article provides a balanced, critical perspective on the refinery's governance and environmental footprint.
